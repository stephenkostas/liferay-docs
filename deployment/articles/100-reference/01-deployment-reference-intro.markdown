# Deployment Reference

[TOC levels=1-4]

Here you'll find definitions, default settings, templates, and more. Here are
some of the topics:

-   [Liferay Home](/deployment/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/liferay-home):
    From this location, @product@ launches applications, applies configurations,
    loads JAR files, and generates logs. 

-   [Portal properties](/deployment/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/portal-properties): 
    Use a `portal-ext.properties` file (or another qualified properties file) to
    configure @product@ and override features. 

-   [System properties](/deployment/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/system-properties):
    Examine @product@ default system configuration. 

-   [Database templates](/deployment/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/database-templates):
    Use these portal properties templates to specify the @product@ database. 

-   [Elasticsearch settings](/deployment/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/elasticsearch-settings):
    Examine the configuration settings for Liferay's default Elasticsearch
    adapter.
