# Publishing Files [](id=publishing-files)

As you create sites, you'll probably want to share files on them. @product@'s 
Documents and Media library (Document Library) let's you upload and publish all 
kinds of files on your sites. Pictures, videos, spreadsheets, slide 
presentations and more can be stored in and shared from the Document Library. 
Document Library instances can be scoped to a @product@ instance, site, or page, 
so you can work with files where they're relevant. 

In these guides, you'll learn how to add files, display them, and collaborate on
them. You can upload all kinds of files, including custom file types, to the
Document Library. Users can then browse and view files from the Media Gallery or
Documents and Media apps. You'll learn how to use both apps. And lastly, you'll
learn how to collaborate on files from within several environments, including
your browser, local desktop, and mobile device. We've pulled out all the stops
to simplify online file management. Let's get the ball rolling by adding files
to a Document Library.
