# Publishing Files Summary [](id=publishing-files-summary)

You've learned the fundamentals of uploading, managing, and collaborating on
files in your sites. The Document Library integrates each file into @product@,
allowing you to apply permissions, workflows, and rich metadata. And it provides
a version control system for managing document progress. You displayed image
files on pages using the Media Gallery and Documents and Media apps. And you've
mastered checking out and checking in new file versions using the basic
download/upload technique and by mapping your local file manager to the Document
Library, for seamless file editing. Congratulations on your document management
accomplishments!
