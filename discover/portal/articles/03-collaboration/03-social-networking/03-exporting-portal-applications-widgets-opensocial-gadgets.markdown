# Exporting @product@ Applications To Other Websites [](id=exporting-portal-applications-as-widgets-and-opensocia)

@product@ can publish its applications to other websites in a variety of formats.
These range from simple widgets to standards like OpenSocial. This lets you
provide your application or content in the context of another website, easily.
Read on to find out how this is done. 

## Sharing OpenSocial Gadgets [](id=sharing-opensocial-gadgets)

OpenSocial consists of a set of APIs for social networking. It may be beneficial
for you to share applications from your @product@ server with other sites, such 
as 
[ighome.com](http://ighome.com) or
[igoogleportal.com](http://igoogleportal.com). These sites let users customize
their own pages with gadgets. @product@ users can share their applications
on any OpenSocial-compatible site. Let's try this now.

For our example, we'll share @product@'s Blogs app: 

1. Add the Blogs app to your @product@ page. 

2. Click the app's *Options* icon 
   (![Options](../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) and select 
   *Configuration*.

3. In the *Sharing* tab, open the *OpenSocial Gadget* section. 

4. Set the selector to *YES* for *Allow users to add Blogs to an OpenSocial 
   platform*. In the *OpenSocial Gadget URL* field, replace `localhost:8080` 
   with the name of your public domain and port.

5. Click *Save*. 

6. Close the dialog and click the app's *Options* icon 
   (![Options](../../../images/icon-app-options.png)). There's a new option 
   available named *Add to an OpenSocial Platform*. Select this option to add 
   the app to a page on an OpenSocial platform. 

By going through this process, @product@ shared the your app's URL to the 
OpenSocial platform. The URL you provided is unique to your specific instance of 
the app. This lets you share multiple instances of the same app as different 
Gadgets.

You can use this sharing capability to let users view what's happening on your
site at a glance.
