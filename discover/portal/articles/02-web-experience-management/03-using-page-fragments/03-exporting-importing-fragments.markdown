# Exporting and Importing Fragments

Often you'll have a set group of Fragments that you're working with across 
sites, organized into Collections. You can easily export and import collection 
to move them across Liferay instances or sites within an instance. Fragment 
Collections are imported and exported from the Fragments page in Site 
Administration. To export Fragments from the Fragments page:

1.  In the top right corner of the screen click on the menu button and select
    *Export*.
    
2.  A zip file will be generated containing all of the Fragments and 
    Collections from your current position in the Fragment hierarchy.
    
If you want to export all of the Fragments associated with the current site, you
can export from the root of the Collections hierarchy. Alternatively, you can 
navigate to a specific collection if you only want to export that collection 
and not any others.

Fragments are exported in a simple .zip format which contains a hierarchy of 
collections, along with all of the HTML, CSS, and JS in text format. You 
import Fragments in the same way that you exported them:

1.  In the top right corner of the screen click on the menu button, and select 
    *Import*.
    
2.  Select a zip file containing exported Fragments collections.

You will now have a selection of Fragments to use. The Fragments will be 
organized in the Collections they were exported as.
