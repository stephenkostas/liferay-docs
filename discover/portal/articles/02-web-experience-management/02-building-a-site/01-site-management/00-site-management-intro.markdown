In Liferay, you can  have many Sites on one Liferay instance, which work 
together to create one complete website, or you can simply have one Site which 
contains all of your pages and content. In this section you'll look at the 
interface for creating and managing Sites, create a Site, and learn how to use 
Site Templates for more efficient Site creation.
