# Using the WYSIWYG Editor [](id=using-the-wysiwyg-editor)

Once you've clicked *Add* &rarr; *Basic Web Content*, you'll find a highly
customizable form that, by default, has three fields: title, summary, and a
powerful WYSIWYG editor. You're also provided a boolean *Searchable* switch. You
could customize this form to contain whatever fields your content needs but
you'll keep things simple for now. If web content structures have already been
created in your currently selected scope, you can select one for your new web
content article by clicking the *Structure and Template* dropdown. You'll
discuss web content structures and templates in detail in the next chapter.

Getting a new web site up and running is an exciting step for anyone, whether it
is a large corporation or a small non-profit charity. To celebrate this
momentous achievement at the Lunar Resort, you'll give our announcement some of
the pomp and circumstance it deserves!

Type the words *Welcome to the Lunar Resort* in the *Title* field. In the
*Summary* field, give a short description of the Lunar Resort's facilities. In
the *Content* field, you'll add the body of your web content article, which
you'll dive into next. Lastly, leave the *Searchable* switch enabled. Note that
if you disable the searchability of your article, it only prevents end users
from finding the article via search. Administrators still have the ability to
search for the article from the Web Content section in the Menu.

The kneejerk reaction to the simplistic looking WYSIWYG editor is "Where are the
editor's controls?" Don't let the simplistic look of the editor fool you; the
editor gives you a seamless writing experience, displaying controls when you
need them and hiding them from view when they're unnecessary. This keeps the
editor space uncluttered so you can focus on your main objective: writing. As
you create content, the context-specific controls appear.

First, add some text that will serve as the heading in your article. If you
highlight the text, controls appear. These controls let you style the text,
provide a link, or share the article on Twitter. For your heading text, select
the *Styles* dropdown and give your heading a *Heading 1* style.

Whenever you place your cursor in the content area, the *Add* icon
(![WYSIWYG Add](../../../images/icon-wysiwyg-add.png)) appears. If you click on
it, controls for inserting an image, table, or horizontal line
(![Controls](../../../images/icon-content-insert-controls.png)) appear. To
insert an image, select the icon that depicts a mountain silhouette. The image
file selector screen appears, allowing you to choose an existing image or upload
a new one. If you select an existing image in your Documents and Media 
repository, you can access the 
[image editor](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/editing-images), 
via the pencil icon 
(![Pencil](../../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png)) in the bottom right corner of 
the preview window, to make changes to the image. Once you've made edits, a copy 
of the image is automatically created for you to use in your web content. 

![Figure 3: You can access the image editor through the item selector window.](../../../images/image-editor-preview-window.png)

After adding an image to the web content article, clicking it brings up controls
([![Image Controls](../../../images/icon-wysiwyg-image-controls.png)) for
justifying it to the left, center, or right side of the article. You can also
make it a link and define the `alt` HTML attribute.

Go ahead an add an image to the Lunar Resort article, to spice it up a bit. Note
that when adding an image via the web content editor, you can either select the
file from the Documents and Media app or provide it via a URL.

You can also insert a table with as many rows and columns as you see fit. When
clicking inside the table, table editing controls appear. They let you designate
the first row and/or column as table headers, and also enable you to add rows,
columns, and cells. You also have the option to insert a horizontal line, which
is a good seperator between sub-articles or an article and its title. Now you're
familiar with the editor's regular mode.

For those content creators that would rather write in HTML code, the editor also
caters to those individuals. To switch the editor to source view, select the
*Source* icon (![WYSIWYG Source](../../../images/icon-wysiwyg-source.png)). Note that
the regular mode icon (![Regular Mode](../../../images/icon-paint-roller.png))
appears, which you can select to return to regular mode. You also have the
option to switch between a dark and light theme by choosing the moon and sun
icons. The built-in syntax coloring helps you identify HTML elements, regardless
of the mode you're using.

You can even work in a dual pane view that shows your HTML code on the left and
a preview pane on the right. To open this view, click on the *Enlarge* icon
(![Enlarge](../../../images/icon-enlarge.png)). You can arrange the HTML and
preview panes horizonally or vertically. You can also hide the preview pane, if
preferred.

![Figure 4: You can view how your HTML would render by using the preview pane.](../../../images/web-content-editor-html.png)

Every 25 seconds, the entry you're creating is automatically saved as a draft.
Because of this, you never have to worry about losing your work if something
unforeseen happens in your browser or on your computer. You can exit the
enlarged editor by clicking the *Done* button at the bottom of the screen.

Add a few short sentences announcing the grand opening of the Lunar Resort. The
content can be localized in whatever language you want. You'll learn more about
localizing your content later on.

## Web Content Options

The bottom menu of the New Web Content form provides options for customizing
your web content.

![Figure 7: New web content can be customized in various ways using the menu located below the WYSIWYG editor.](../../../images/wcm-menu.png)

**Structure and Template:** lets you customize the web content article's
structure and template. To learn more about web content structures and
templates, visit the [Designing Uniform Content](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/designing-uniform-content)
section.

**Small Image:** sets the image that is used for the web content article's
previews. For example, when viewing an article in the Web Content library, the
small image is displayed as the article's icon.

**Metadata:** let you set the organizational hierarchy of the web content
article by selecting tags, categories, and priority. To learn more about tags
and categories, visit the
[Organizing Content with Tags and Categories](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/organizing-content-with-tags-and-categories)
section.

**Schedule:** customizes the date and time your content publishes and/or
expires. To learn more about scheduling content, visit the
[Scheduling Web Content Publication](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/scheduling-web-content-publication)
section.

**Display Page:** lets you determine where the web contents are displayed when
linked from other pages. The Canonical URL can be used here. The Canonical URL
is unique for articles that redirect the visitor to the article's default
display page.

Imagine you have a newspaper with a sports section and a technology section. You
add a Sports page and a Tech page to your site, each one with a specific banner
and look and feel. You want the articles to appear in the appropriate pages, but
you know in @product@, articles are not related to pages. You can add an article
as often as you like in different web content display apps or in configured
Asset Publishers. But if you have a *View in context* link, where will you show
your article? This is where you'd use a default display page. Articles that have
a default display page defined are shown with other related articles in the same
display page.

Imagine you have 100 sports articles and 100 tech articles. Instead of needing
to create a page for each article to show it, you can have only one sports page
and one tech page, and can show all articles in one place in a consistent
fashion. You'll work through an example of creating a display page in the
[Creating a Display Page](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/publishing-basic-web-content#creating-a-display-page)
sub-section.

**Related Assets:** lets you determine content relationships between the web
content article and other assets in your Liferay instance, even if they don't
share any tags and aren't in the same category. You can connect your content to
a Blogs Entry, Message Boards Message, Web Content, Calendar Event, Bookmarks
Entry, Documents and Media Document, Wiki Page, etc. To learn more about
defining content relationships and publishing links to those related assets,
visit the
[Defining Content Relationships](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/defining-content-relationships)
section.

![Figure 8: This blog entry has links to three Related Assets: one web content and two message board entries.](../../../images/related-assets-link.png)

**Permissions:** customizes who has access to the content. By default, content
is viewable by Anyone (Guest Role). You can limit viewable permissions by
selecting any Role from the drop-down or in the list. Additionally, @product@
provides the ability to customize permissions in more detail. Select the *More
Options* link below the drop down button and you'll find the different
activities you can grant or deny to your web content article.

While you can set permissions here, they are ignored unless you activate Web
Content Article permissions in your System Configuration: 

1. Go to the *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings*.

2. Search or browse for *Web Content (Default Settings for All Instances)*.

3. Check the box labeled *Article view permissions check enabled*.

4. Click *Save*.

Once it is activated, any permissions you set in the article's configuration are
checked before displaying the article.

+$$$

**Version Note:** This property is only available with Fix Pack
de-13 installed. If you do not have the latest fix packs installed, set the 
`journal.article.view.permission.check.enabled=` to `true` in your 
`portal-ext.properties` file and restart Liferay to activate the permission 
check.

Before you display your web content, you'll learn how to localize it to cater to
different language speaking users.
