# Creating and Managing Site Navigation Menus

With Modern Site Building, @product_version@ introduces a new paradigm in site
navigation. Previously, all pages were automatically added to your navigation 
menu and if you needed to change or customize those, it involved a lot of work 
and maybe a little hack or two. Now you can customize your menus any way you 
like - rearranging pages into any order with any hierarchy to be displayed 
anywhere on your site.

Particularly devious designers might see this as an opportunity to design an
inescapable M.C. Escher-esque labyrinth of navigation, but you're not one of
those right? Thoughtful designers and administrators can create page and 
navigation flows designed to improve user experiences and guide users to the
information or products that they're looking for.
