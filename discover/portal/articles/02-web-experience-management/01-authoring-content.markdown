# Authoring Content: Structured and Inline Content

The primary goal of Content Management isn't to show off the flashiest new 
features or follow all the latest trends in design, but to provide you with the
tools you need to create digital content that communicates your message clearly and effectively. With this in mind, Liferay offers two core tools to help you accelerate and simplify creating and organizing content - Structured Web Content and Inline Content.

## Structured Web Content

Structured Content is content that is created within a predefined content 
structure and then added to pages as needed. It uses a structure and template to
define it's styles and exists in the site where it is created independent of 
any page.

The structure defines what kind of content you are creating and provides different types of fields that can be used. A developer could create a format
for publishing articles which contains a **Title**, **Header Image**, **Body Text**, and a **Key Quotation**. The template defines how the elements of the structure are rendered. You could style the elements in our structure with the **Title** as large bold text, the **Header Image** as a full page width block above the title, the **Text** as standard text, and the **Key Quotation** as large font italics with a thin border that displays within the main text section. A content writer or marketer could then create any number of articles, all having a uniform style based on the structure.

In Liferay, those articles could be added to pages across the site, or displayed dynamically with tools like the Asset Publisher and Web Content Display Pages.

## Inline Content

Inline Content is content that is created directly within a page. [DO BETTER] Content Pages start with a design which is then created in Fragments with HTML, [STOP TALKING ABOUT HTML AND CSS]CSS, and JavaScript, along with Liferay specific tags which enables developers to create editable text and images within a page. The content itself is then created either in the HTML itself, or directly in the page before publishing it.
[WHAT IT IS - NOT HOW IT IS CREATED]

The HTML and CSS define the primary design, while JavaScript and Liferay specific tags can add dynamic behavior to the Content Page. After a developer creates the page, and a content writer or marketer provides the content, the content exists inline within the page, and is published with it.

Often it is helpful to have reusable elements or content that can be moved around a page or placed anywhere on a site. For example, you might have a content based banner which you want to be able to drop onto any various pages with different layouts and styles, or you might have content where you are using the same template to create similar items for different pages. Structured Content is the tool you need to quickly create what you need and manage these cases.

In other cases, you need to create a page as a complete unit. For example, you have a series of marketing driven landing pages need to match a specific design and have associated content (like text and images) intended for use on that page or with that campaign. Content Pages provide the best tool for quickly bringing a design to life and empowering marketing with inline content.

Most sites are going to need a little bit of both. Content Pages are great for your front page or landing pages, but Structured Content provides more options for creating longform content or building web applications.
