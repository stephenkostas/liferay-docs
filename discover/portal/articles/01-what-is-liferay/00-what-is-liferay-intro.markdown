Let's attempt some mind reading: you're reading this because you need to build
a website. You're thinking about using @product@ for your site, or you've already
decided to use it and you want to learn all about it. Either way, you've come to
the right place. What you'll find here is that @product@ is the right
decision, and we'll be happy to tell you all the reasons why. But since you
might be in a rush, we'll give you all the reasons in a nutshell right here, and
then you can read the details in the rest of the articles. 

The reasons to use @product@ for your website are simple: it provides a
robust *platform* to build your site on quickly and serve it to all clients, be
they desktop, mobile, or anything in between; it provides all the standard
*applications* you need to run on your site; and it provides an easy to use
development *framework* for new applications or customization. In addition to
this, @product@ is developed using an open source methodology, by people
from around the world. The code base is solid and has been proved to be
reliable and stable in mission critical deployments in diverse industries. 

But don't just take our word for it. Let us *show* you how Liferay does all
this. Probably the first thing you want to do after you install @product@
to manage your site is to get your content published. Let's dive right in and
see how @product@ handles that task.
