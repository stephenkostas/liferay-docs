# Key New Features in Content and Site Management

@product_ver@ introduces several new features in Web Experience Management that 
expand your ability to create, manage, and display content and pages. The new
features will help you realize all of your Site building and Content goals with
Liferay.

## Inline Content

In previous versions of Liferay, all content was created in its own context, 
and then could be displayed anywhere on a site. Content Pages expands this 
paradigm, enabling you to focus on page specific design and create in-page 
content. With Content Pages, you can create pages with a combination of
raw text, images, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that designers and web developers 
will love, and content writers and marketers then have the power to manage the 
text and image content inline, in the page. The tools in Liferay for creating 
Content Pages streamline the process for designers and developers creating the 
pages, and empower content creators.

## Flexible Navigation

@product_ver@ introduces the ability to create multiple customizable navigation menus. This allows you to tailor the navigation for specific pages and provide more flexible navigation options. The new Navigation Menus can include or exclude any number of pages on your site, but can also include external sites or other resources directly in your navigation.

## Web Content Display Pages

Web Content Display pages allow for expanded customization of the look and feel of web content on a page. Display pages integrate with Friendly URLs to provide friendly direct links to view content that you create in its intended context and improve SEO. This is especially powerful for creating long-form content.
