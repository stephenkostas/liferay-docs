# Styling Widgets with Application Display Templates [](id=styling-widgets-with-application-display-templates)

ADTs are all about customization. Suppose you're customizing the Lunar Resort
site and want to allow users to use Facebook or Twitter to communicate with
other interested travelers. You can add this functionality to an existing
widget using ADTs --- launch a template editor, create a custom template, and
configure your app host that template. Custom templates let you re-skin your
application and give you ultimate control over its appearance and
functionality in your Liferay instance.

## Creating an ADT

Let's walk through the process of creating an ADT:

1.  From Site Administration click the *Site Selector* button 
    (![Compass](../../../../../images/icon-compass.png)) to choose the site where you
    want to create the ADT. 
    
2.  Open *Build* &rarr; *Application Display Templates*.    
    
If you selected the Global context, this page shows you a list of sample 
templates available for your apps. These sample templates differ from the 
default templates already configured in the apps. If you choose a site to host 
your template, you must create a custom template for that site's apps.

3.  Click the *Add*
    (![Add](../../../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) button and you will be 
    prompted to select the type of template to create.

- *Asset Publisher*
- *Blogs*
- *Breadcrumb*
- *Categories Navigation*
- *Language Selector*
- *Media Gallery*
- *Navigation Menu*
- *RSS Publisher*
- *Site Map*
- *Tags Navigation*
- *Wiki*

4.  Then enter the name and, optionally, open *Details* to provide a 
    description and a small image to use. You can select the language type for 
    your template
    
5.  Within *Details* select a scripting language to use. You can use Freemarker
    or Velocity.
    
6.  Use the *Script* section to create the ADT.

7.  Click *Save* when done.

### The Template Editor

On the left side of the template editor, you'll notice a palette of common
variables used for making templates. This is a great reference when creating
your template. To place one of the variables into the template editor,
position your text cursor where you want it placed, and click the variable name.

Each variable also has a tooltip which will display a more detailed 
description. Because there are multiple kinds of ADTs, there are also different 
variables for each ADT. Thus, each template has a different set of variables 
only applicable for that specific template. 

![Figure 2: Liferay offers a versatile script editor to customize your ADT.](../../../../../images/adt-script-editor.png)

You can also use the autocomplete feature to add variables to your template. It
can be invoked by typing *${* which opens a drop-down menu of available
variables. By clicking one of the variables, the editor inserts the variable
into the editor.

You also have the ability to embed same-type templates into other templates. For
example, suppose you have an existing Wiki ADT and would like to create another
similar Wiki ADT. Instead of starting from scratch, you can import the existing
Wiki ADT into your new one and build off of it. In other words, you can utilize
ADTs as generic templates which allow for reusable code to be imported by
Velocity or FreeMarker templates in the system. For more information on how to
create a custom template, visit the
[Implementing Application Display Templates](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/implementing-application-display-templates)
tutorial.

## Configuring ADTs

After you've completed the initial set up and saved your ADT, you can manage
your ADT through its *Actions* (![Actions](../../../../../images/icon-actions.png))
button. This provides several options:

- *Edit*: lets you modify the ADT's setup properties.
- *Permissions*: lets you manage the permissions *Update*, *Permissions*,
  *Delete*, and *View* for the ADT.
- *Copy*: creates a copy of the ADT.
- *Delete*: deletes the ADT.

Additionally, your ADT generates a static URL and a WebDAV URL. These values
access the XML source of your template. You can find these URLs by clicking the
ADT from the menu and expanding the *Details* section. With the WebDAV URL, site
administrators are capable of adding, browsing, editing, and deleting ADTs on a
remote server. If you'd like to learn more about what the WebDAV URL can do,
visit the section on
[WebDAV access](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/publishing-files#desktop-access-to-documents-and-media).

**Note:** Embedding apps into ADTs, although possible, is not recommended
because this could cause conflicts with other apps or unexpected behavior (e.g.,
embedding an app that aggregates data to the breadcrumb). If embedding an app
into an ADT is your only option, make sure it does not interfere with other
apps.

Next you need to configure the application to use the new ADT:

1.  Go to the *Configuration* page for the application you want to modify and open its *Display Settings*.

2.  Under *Display Template*, select your ADT from the drop-down menu.

Also, you can manage site-specific display templates for your app: do this by 
clicking the *Manage Display Templates for [SPECIFIC_SITE]* link next to the 
*Display Template* drop-down menu. A window will display with a list of your 
configured templates only available for your site with options to add new 
templates or edit existing templates.
