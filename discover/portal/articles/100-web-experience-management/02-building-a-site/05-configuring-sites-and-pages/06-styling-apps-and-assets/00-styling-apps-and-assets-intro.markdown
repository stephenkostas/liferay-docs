# Styling Apps and Assets

Application Display Template (ADTs) allow Liferay administrators to expand the 
way your siteâ€™s content is displayed. With ADTs, you can define custom display 
templates used to render applications. For example, you may want to show blog 
entries horizontally instead of vertically, or list your assets in the asset 
publisher application in different sizes. In this section you'll learn about 
the capabilities of ADTs and how to create and configure them.
