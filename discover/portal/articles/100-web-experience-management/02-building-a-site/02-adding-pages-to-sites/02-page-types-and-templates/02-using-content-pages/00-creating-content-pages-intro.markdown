# Using Content Pages [](id=using-page-fragments)

Content Pages are new in @product-ver@. The goal of Content Page is to provide a
way to create pages with inline content. Where traditionally in Liferay, all 
content has lived outside of the page, to be added to any page as needed. With
Content Pages, you can create a design on a page and then edit text or images 
directly within the page without any abstraction between the page and the 
content.

The process starts with a design. After the design is completed a developer 
creates carefully crafts Fragments based on those designs, along 
with the ability to embed Liferay Widgets into the Fragment. Those Fragments 
can then be converted into Page Templates - and here's where the magic happens. 
Developers can define areas of Fragments to have editable text or images, which 
can be edited during the final publication process for the page.

This means that Fragments can be created as completely static elements to be 
used to build a Content Page, or they can allow marketers or content creators 
to customize them and use the Fragment as a tool for creating beautiful content.
