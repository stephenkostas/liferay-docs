# Displaying Pages on Mobile Devices

In 2018, more than half of all page views in the world come from mobile devices 
like phones and tablets. That means that if your pages don't look good on 
mobile devices then your pages don't look good for more than half the people 
looking at them. With that in mind, @product@ is designed to provide the best 
experience possible no matter what device you're using.

Most of the heavy lifting for mobile optimization is going to come from your 
developers. Themes need to be designed with mobile in mind. Web Content 
Structures and Templates and Page Fragments need to be created with code that 
will gracefully transition to fit smaller screens on mobile devices. But 
there's work to do for marketers and administrators as well.
