# Mobile Device Rules [](id=mobile-device-rules)

Mobile device families allow you to configure sets of rules to alter the
behavior of the instance based on the device being used to access @product@. 
For instance, you can configure the look and feel of Liferay pages accessed by
smartphone or tablet users differently from those accessed by PC users.

Both sites and individual pages can be configured with any number of mobile
device families. A family is designed to describe a group of devices. It can
contain one or more rules that describe a category of devices, such as all
Android devices or all iOS tablets. You can define as many rules in a family as
you need to classify all the devices for which you'd like to define actions.
Families can be prioritized to determine which one applies to a given page
request.
