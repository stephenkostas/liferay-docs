# Managing Users in Your Site

Users and Sites are two of the most important concepts in @product@. Sites are
were all of your content and pages are stored, and users are the ones who are 
accessing and creating that content. While user management is covered in depth 
in our [User Management tutorial](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/roles-and-permissions),
there are other user configuration options that are specific to Site Management.

You can configure social options that enable users to interact with content, as 
well as organizing and empowering users using **Default User Associations** and 
**Teams***. In this section you'll learn to manage and configure these site 
options for users.
