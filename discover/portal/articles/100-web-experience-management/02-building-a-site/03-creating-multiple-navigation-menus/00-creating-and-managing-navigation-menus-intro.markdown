# Creating and Managing Site Navigation Menus [](id=creating-and-managing-site-navigation-menus)

With @product_ver@ you can create and rearrange the way pages, content, and 
applications are displayed using customizable Navigation Menus. Navigation 
Menus equip marketers with the flexibility to easily create and manage multiple 
navigation menus, like a main menu, secondary menus, footer menus, and custom 
menus for anything that you can dream up.

On a large complex site you can create a Navigation Menu which displays a 
simple list of frequently visited pages and move the rest of the pages to a 
secondary navigation. You can also create specific menus for different landing 
pages to direct users to content that is relevant to them.

The default menu functions just like it always has: when you add a page, it is
added to the menu. You can create subpages and build the page hierarchy out any
way you like. Go to *Navigation* &rarr; *Site Pages* to view the existing pages
or create new pages.

The site hierarchy as displayed on the *Site Pages* page is the main reference 
for the organization of pages on that site. While Navigation menus can customize
their organization and what appears and what doesn't appear, this menu is 
always the primary reference for the pages on your site.
