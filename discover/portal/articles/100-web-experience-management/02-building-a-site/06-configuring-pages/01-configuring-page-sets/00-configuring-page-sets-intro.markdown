# Configuring Page Sets

To configure options for the entire page set, select *Configure* from the menu 
in the top right corner of *Pages*. Options configured for the Page Set will 
apply to all the pages contained within it. Page Set options will override 
options set at the Site level, and customizations to an individual page will
override those set for the Page Set.
