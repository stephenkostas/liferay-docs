# Customizing Page Options [](id=customizing-page-options)

Every page has options to give it a unique configuration. You can handle that 
configuration at the individual page level or configure a Page Set of public or 
private pages all at once.

When you configure options across Sites, Page Sets, and individual pages, there 
is a hierarchy that flows down. For example: You can set a theme at the Site 
level, which applies to all pages within a Site. You could then set a different 
theme for the Private Pages set which is different than what's specified for 
the whole site. On top of that, you could also set a different theme for a 
specific page that is different than the master site configuration or the 
configuration for the page set that it belongs to.

When configuring pages, it's important to be aware of the specific context 
you're in, so that you don't configure an option that you intended for the 
whole site just on one page --- or change the whole site's configuration, when 
you meant to change it for only a specific page.
