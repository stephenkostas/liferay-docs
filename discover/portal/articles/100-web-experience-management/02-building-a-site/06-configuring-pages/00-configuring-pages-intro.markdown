# Customizing Page Options [](id=customizing-page-options)

The next level of configuration under Sites is pages. When it comes to pages, 
you can handle configuration at the individual page level or configure a set of 
public or private pages all at once.

One example of how this hierarchy flows down is themes. You can configure a 
theme at the Site level, which applies to all pages within a Site. You could 
then configure a different theme for the Private Pages set which is different 
than what's specified for the whole site. On top of that, you could also 
configure a different theme for a specific page that is different than the 
master site configuration or the configuration for the page set that it belongs 
to.

Many configuration options are like this, so, when configuring pages, it's 
important to be aware of the specific context you're in, so that you don't 
configure an option that you intended for the whole site just on one page --- 
or change the whole site's configuration, when you meant to change it for only 
the particular page set.
