# Changing Page Permissions [](id=changing-page-permissions)

Public pages are just that: public. They can be viewed by anybody,
logged in or not logged in. And private pages are only private from
non-members of the site. If someone has joined your site or is a member of your
organization, that person can see all the private pages. You can modify the 
permissions on individual pages in either page group so only certain users can 
view them.

You can create a page only for administrators to see like this:

1.  Go to your site's Site Administration dropdown and select *Build*
    &rarr; *Pages* &rarr; *Private Pages*. 

2.  Create a page called *Admin Tips*.

3.  Click *Configure Page* from the Options button dropdown for the page in the
    left menu.

4.  Select *Permissions* from the *Options* icon
    (![Options](../../../../../images/icon-options.png)) in the top right corner of
    the screen.

4.  Uncheck the *View* and *Add Discussion* permissions next to the Site Member
    role.

5.  Click the *Save* button.

Congratulations! You've changed the permissions for this page so only site
administrators can view it. Any users you add to this role can now see the page.
Other users, even members of this site, won't have permission to see it.

Pages are as flexible as pages you'd create manually without a Liferay instance.
Using a point and click interface, you can define your site any way you want.
You can create and remove pages, export and import them, set their layouts,
define how they are indexed by search engines, and more.
