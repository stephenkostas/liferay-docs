# Configuring Individual Pages

After you've configured broader items for your entire Page Set, you can 
reconfigure some options at the individual page with more detail. When you 
decide to customize a single page, options that were not available when
initially creating a page appear. You can customize a specific page by
navigating to *Pages* under *Build* menu and selecting *Options*
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)) &rarr; *Configure*
next to the page you want to edit from the navigation tree. Alternatively, you
can click the Configure icon on the top right of any page as you are viewing it.
