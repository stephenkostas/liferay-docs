# Application Permissions [](id=application-permissions)

All of Liferay's widgets support @product@'s robust, fine-grained permissions
system. Some higher level permissions can be configured in the permissions tab
of the widgets's configuration dialog box. You can grant roles permission to:

- Add a display template
- Add the widget to a page
- Configure the app
- Modify the widget's permissions
- Modify the widget's preferences
- View the widget

To set these permissions, go to the widget's *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) and click select *Permissions*.
This shows you a table of roles defined in the Liferay instance. Use the check
boxes to grant certain permissions to different roles. Click *Save* after you've
made your selections.

Beyond this, specific permissions are generally defined for specific
applications. For example, Message Boards contains a *Ban User* permission. 
This makes no sense in the context of another applications, say, the Blogs. 
You'll go over permissions for specific applications in the sections for those 
applications. Next, you'll explore how to sharing applications.
