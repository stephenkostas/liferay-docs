# Configuring Widgets [](id=configuring-applications)

Just like siblings have common features inherited from their parents,
widgets that ship with @product@ also share common features. These include
look and feel, exporting/importing app data, communication, sharing,
permissions, scoping, and configuration templates. You'll learn how these
features work together to facilitate information flow within @product@ and 
provide an enhanced experience for your users. So before you get into the nitty 
gritty of the widgets themselves, it's best to cover these common features 
first, starting with the look and feel configuration options.
