# Designing Web Content with Templates [](id=designing-web-content-with-templates)

Developers create templates to display the elements of the structure in the
markup they want. In essence, templates are scripts that tell @product@ how to 
display content in the structure. Any changes to the structure require 
corresponding changes to the template, because new or deleted fields produce 
errors on the page. A structure cannot be displayed without a template, and a
template cannot exist without a structure. Without a template, @product@ has no idea how to display content  which has been created using a custom structure.

You'll look more closely at the types of templates @product@ supports next.
