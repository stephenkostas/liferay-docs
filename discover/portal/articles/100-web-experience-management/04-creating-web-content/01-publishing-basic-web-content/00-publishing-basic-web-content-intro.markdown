# Publishing Basic Web Content [](id=publishing-basic-web-content)

@product@'s Web Content Management is a powerful and robust tool for creating and
organizing content on your web site. You'll begin by examining some basic
concepts involving sites and pages.

As you'll see, @product@'s WCM is a full-featured solution for managing your web
site. You'll start with an overview of what it has to offer and then you'll dive
down into its features. Note that web content is just one kind of asset on
Liferay. Other types of content (blog posts, wiki articles, message board posts,
etc.) are also considered assets. @product@ provides a general framework for
handling assets that includes tags, categories, comments, ratings, and more.
Please see the
[Publishing Content Dynamically](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/publishing-content-dynamically)
section for more information on Liferay's asset framework.
