# Welcome Page Cleanup

Before get started building your own content, you want to get rid of the sample
content currently on the page.

1. Start your server, if you haven't already.

2. Your default browser will automatically open to 
    `localhost:8080/web/guest/home` when Liferay is finished starting.
    
3. Login in as the administrative account. The default is `test@liferay.com` 
    with the password "test".
