# Creating Basic Content

Your first step is to create some basic web content using the features of 
Liferay's default editor. You'll make some basic edits to an existing page, and 
then create content with simple text and an image.

These exercises assume that you've downloaded, unzip, and performed the basic 
setup of a @product@ bundle. If you haven't completed this yet, you can 
download @product@ here: https://www.liferay.com/downloads

For information about setting up Liferay, see the [Installing Liferay Portal tutorial](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-liferay-portal)
