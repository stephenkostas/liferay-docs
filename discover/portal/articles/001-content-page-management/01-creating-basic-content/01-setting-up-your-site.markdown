# Setting Up Your Site

Before get started building your own content, you want to get rid of the sample
content currently on the page.

1. Start your server, if you haven't already.

2. Your default browser will automatically open to 
    `localhost:8080/web/guest/home` when Liferay is finished starting.
    
3. Login in as the administrative account. The default is `test@liferay.com` 
    with the password *test*.

The default Welcome page contains the *Hello World* portlet and nothing else.
You can also see the Site title and the default logo. First, remove the *Hello 
World* portlet from the page.

1. Mouse over the portlet to make the border appear.

2. Click on the options menu (3 vertically stacked dots on the top right side).

3. Select *Remove*.

4. When prompted "Are you sure you want to remove this component?" Click *OK*.

Next, you need to update the Site name and the logo.

1. Open the main menu. You will see the icon to open it in the top left corner 
    of the browser window.

2. Click on *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings*.

3. Under *General* &rarr; *Main Configuration* change the name from "Liferay"
    to "Lunar Resort".
    
4. Scroll down to the bottom of the screen and click *Save*.

5. Scroll back to the top, and click on the *Miscellaneous* tab.

6. Under *Logo*, click *Change*.

7. In the pop up window that appears click *Select*.

8. Navigate to the location where you download the provided 
    `lunar-resort-logo.png` file, and select it.

9. Click *Done* and then *Save*.

If you look in the top left corner of the screen, above your menu options, you can now see the logo and site name have been updated. Click on that to go back to your home page, and view your changes in context. Next you'll create a piece of welcome content to replace the one you removed.
