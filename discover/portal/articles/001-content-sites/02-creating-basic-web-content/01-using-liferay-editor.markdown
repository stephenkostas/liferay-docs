# Using Liferay's Content Editor

The Add button allows you to add content to a page, but before you can add 
content to a page, you first need to create it.

1. Open the Menu.

2. Under *The Lunar Resort* select *Content*.

3. Select *Web Content*.

This page serves as the hub for all of the content that you create for the 
Lunar Resort site. This is where you go to create content, and as you create 
content, it will all appear here if you need to edit or review it.

Let's get started.

1. Click the `+` button in the bottom right corner of the screen and select
    *Basic Web Content*.
    
This opens up the web content editor. There are a lot of options here, but what 
you should be concerned with now are *Title*, *Summary*, and *Content*. The 
*Publish* button will prove to be important as well.

2. For the *Title* enter "Lunar Resort Welcome".

3. For the *Summary* enter "Welcome page content for the Lunar Resort."

The *Content* is where things are going to get a little tricky.

1. Enter the text "Make Memories at the Lunar Resort"

2. Select the text with your cursor.

3. In the dialog that appears above the text, change *Normal* to *Heading 1*.

4. Deselect the text, and make a new line.

5. Click the plus button and select image icon.

6. Using either drag and drop or the *Select File* button, upload the provided
    `moon-image1.jpg`.

7. Click *Add* to add the image to the content. This will also add it to the 
    Document Library so that it can be re-used later.

8. Click on the image and then drag the corners to resize it appropriately.

9. Click *Publish* and your web content will be saved and made available for 
    display

Hopefully that didn't tire you out too much, because that's just the beginning. 
The content is created, but it isn't viewable anywhere except in Site 
Administration and the Add menu where only administrators can view. To be 
visible to your other users, you need to add it to a page.
