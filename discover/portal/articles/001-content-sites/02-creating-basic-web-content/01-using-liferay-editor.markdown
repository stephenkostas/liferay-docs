# Using @product@'s Content Editor [](id=using-liferays-content-editor)

    <p>Creating Basic Web Content<br>Step 1 of 2</p>
</div>

Before you can add content to a page, you must first create that content. In 
@product@, you create content independent of a page, and then add it to the page 
(or pages) you want it to appear on. Separating content creation from content 
display lets you display content on multiple pages without recreating it, and 
prevents the loss of content if you remove it from a page or delete the page 
altogether. 

Now you'll learn where to create content for a site: 

1. Open the Menu.

2. Under the site (*The Lunar Resort*), select *Content* &rarr; *Web Content*.

The Web Content page serves as the hub for all of the content that you create 
for the Lunar Resort site. You create, edit, and review content all from this 
page. 

Follow these steps to create some content:

1.  Click the `+` button in the bottom right corner of the screen and select
    *Basic Web Content*.

    This opens up the web content editor. There are many options here, but for 
    now you only need to pay attention to the *Title*, *Summary*, and *Content* 
    fields. These fields are summarized here: 

    - *Title*: The content's title
    - *Summary*: The content's summary. This should be a brief description of 
      the content.
    - *Content*: The content's body. For example, if the content is an image, 
      this field is where you add that image. 

2. In the *Title* field, enter *Lunar Resort Welcome*.

3. In the *Summary* field, enter *Welcome page content for the Lunar Resort*.

Even though the *Content* field resembles a simple, unassuming field like any 
other, it possesses a great deal of power. It's sort of like a super hero. Now 
you'll use it to create your first piece of web content:

1.  In the *Content* field, enter the text *Make Memories at the Lunar Resort*.

2.  Select the text with your cursor.

3.  In the dialog that appears above the text, change *Normal* to *Heading 1*. 
    This formats your text as a first-level heading. Note that you may need to 
    close the Menu for the full dialog above the text to be visible.

4.  Deselect the text, and make a new line.

5.  Click the plus button and select the image icon.

![Figure X: To begin adding an image, select the image icon.](../../../images/001-image-icon.png)

6.  Using drag and drop or the *Select File* button, upload the provided
    `moon-image1.jpg`.

7.  Click *Add* to add the image to the content. This also adds it to the 
    Document Library so that you can re-use it later.

8.  To resize the image if necessary, click it and then drag the corners.

9.  Click *Publish*. This saves your web content and makes it available for 
    display.

Well done! Hopefully that didn't tire you out too much, because that's just the 
beginning. You created the content, but you still need to display it on a page 
for anyone besides an administrator to see it. You'll do this next.
