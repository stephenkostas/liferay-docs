# Creating Content

So far you've created the Lunar Resort site's outline. By creating pages and
using templates, the site now has a structure and the pages have layouts. Now
it's time to color everything in with content.

In this section you'll create content, some with more complex web content
structures and templates, and use Liferay's Web Experience Management to publish
your new content on your site.
