# Creating a Site

So far you set up a server and created some basic content. You could call that 
a "web site" but most of you probably want something a little bit more 
intricate than a single page with a line of text and an image. In order to 
accomplish this, you'll need to create pages, with different layouts to match 
the content and style of that page. Once you're done creating the pages, you
need to create the content that will go on those pages, and use the appropriate
applications for displaying or managing that content.

In this section, you'll focus on the sites and pages, with a quick peak into 
the content which will come next.
