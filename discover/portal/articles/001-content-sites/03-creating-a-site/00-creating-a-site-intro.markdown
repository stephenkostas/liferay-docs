# Creating a Site

In the previous steps of this Learning Path, you set up a @product@ server and 
created some basic web content. Although you *could* call that a web site, most 
users want something a bit more intricate than a single page with a line of text 
and an image. In this part of the Learning Path, you'll create more pages 
(including nested pages) and use page layouts to customize how those pages 
display applications and content. You'll also learn more about adding 
applications to pages, and how to manage site navigation.
