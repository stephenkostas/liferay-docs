# Adding Applications to Pages

All of the functionality on a Liferay page is going to come from applications. Applications can have specific function in and of themselves, or they can display content or forms that users will interact with. In order to add some functionality, let's add some applications to the pages that you just created. 

## The Activities Page

First we'll add some applications to the activities page. This page will be set up with two different configurations for the Asset Publisher. For now, add two asset publishers to the page, one in each column.

1. Navigate to the *Activities* page.

2. Click the `+` button and select *Applications* from the add menu.

3. Open the *Content Management* section.

4. Drag and drop one Asset Publisher to the right column and one to the left 
    column.

## The "About Us" Page

1. Next, go to the *About Us* page.

2. Open the add menu.

3. This time use the search bar to search for "web content display"

4. This page has a 3 column layout. Drag and drop a web content display into
    each column.

## Pages and Applications

As you can see, adding content and applications to pages is a simple process
and you can quickly create and display content using @product@. As you continue
you'll look at more page management and navigation options.
