    <p>Creating A Site<br>Step 3 of 6</p>

All of a page's functionality comes from applications. This functionality can be 
anything as simple as displaying content, or as complex as social networking. 
You create your page's functionality by adding applications to the page. You'll 
get started by adding applications to the Activities and About Us pages. 

## The Activities Page

To begin adding functionality to the Activities page, you'll add two Asset 
Publisher applications to it. Each Asset Publisher can be configured to display 
different assets, like images, web content articles, or any other kind of 
content in @product@. Follow these steps to add two Asset Publishers to the 
page:

1.  Navigate to the *Activities* page. 

2.  Click the *Add* button 
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) on the upper right and expand the 
    *Applications* &rarr; *Content Management* category in the menu. 

3.  Drag and drop one Asset Publisher to the page's right column, and one to the 
    page's left column.

## The About Us Page

To add functionality to the About Us page, you'll add several Web Content 
Display applications to it. Recall that this application displays web content. 
You saw it in action when you displayed basic web content in the previous 
section of this Learning Path. Follow these steps to add Web Content Display to 
the About Us page: 

1.  Navigate to the *About Us* page.

2.  Click the *Add* button 
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) on the upper right and expand the 
    *Applications* category in the menu. 

3.  This time use the search bar to search for *web content display*.

4.  This page's layout has a 3 columns. Drag and drop a Web Content Display 
    application into each column. 

As you can see, adding content and applications to pages is a simple process 
that lets you quickly create and display content in @product@. As you continue, 
you'll learn more about creating content, as well as styling it. Next, however, 
you'll learn about page management and navigation.
