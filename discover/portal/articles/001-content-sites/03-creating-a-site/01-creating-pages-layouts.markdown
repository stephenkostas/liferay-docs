# Creating Pages with Layouts

The Welcome page has the simplest possible layout - 1 Column.
Everything that you add to the page takes up the full width of the page and 
if you add a new application to the page, it will be placed 
above or below the current content. Other layouts allow you to add items side by
side, or in some cases, have multiple row types, with some some sections having 
only one column, while others have multiple columns.

Now you need to create two pages. First, you'll create the *Activities* page, 
which will contain information about the various activities that you can do at 
the Lunar Resort.

After that you'll create the *About Us* page, which contains more information 
about organizations related to the Lunar Resort.

## Creating the Activities Page

The activities page will use a 2 column layout with a smaller column on the 
left side and a larger column on the right side.

1. Open the main menu, and go to *Navigation* for *The Lunar Resort*.

2. Click on the menu button for *Public Pages* and select *Add Public Page*.

You are now on the page creation form. You can set the page name, choose a 
template or layout, and set a number of other options.

3. Enter "Activities" for the *Name*.

4. Select *2 Columns 30/70* for the layout.

5. Click *Add Page*.

You have now added a new page to *The Lunar Resort* site. That site will appear 
in the navigation, and you can add applications and content to the page.

## Creating the About Page

Next you'll create a 3 column layout page for *About Us*.

1. Back in the main menu, go to *Navigation* for *The Lunar Resort*.

2. Click on the menu button for *Public Pages* and select *Add Public Page*.

3. Enter "About Us" for the *Name*.

4. Select *3 Columns* for the layout.

5. Click *Add Page*.

## Checking your pages

Your nav bar will contain the two new pages that you've created. Currently 
there is no content on the pages, but after you're done creating the pages and 
layouts that you need for your site, you'll add applications and content.
