# Nesting Pages

To continue creating your site, you need to create some additional pages as 
Child Pages of an existing page. This is called "nesting" pages In Liferay, you 
can nest pages down to a virtually unlimited level, with sub-pages of sub-pages
of sub-pages and so on.

## Creating Child Pages

There are two ways that you can create a Child Page. The most common way is to 
create a new page as a Child Page of an existing page. In other cases, you can 
also turn an existing page into a Child Page. Since you already created a page 
that you want to move down a level, let's start there.

### Creating Sub-pages with drag and drop

1. Open the main menu.

2. Go to *Lunar Resort* &rarr; *Navigation*.

3. Click and hold on *Cody* and drag it so that it nests under *Lunar Guides*.

Pages can be dragged around and rearranged using the *Navigation* menu. Any 
changes made here are immediately applied to the main navigation structure. So 
now, the *Cody* page has been removed from the top level navigation, and can 
now be found as a sub-page of *Lunar Guides*.

### Creating New Sub-pages

Now you're going to create three more Lunar Guides pages. Each will be nested 
under the *Lunar Guides* page and each will be created using the *Lunar Guide 
Page* template.

1. Click on the menu for *Lunar Guides*.

2. Select *Add Child Page*

3. Name the page "Jim" and set the *Type* as *Lunar Guide Page*.

4. Leave *Inherit Changes* set to "Yes".

5. Click *Add Page*

6. Repeat these steps to create additional pages for "Steve" and "Russ".

Each page is created as specified by the template, with the Blogs to the right
and an empty space to the left.

Now that all of the pages are created, let's take a closer look at navigation 
and the various features of Liferay's Breadcrumb and Navigation portlets.
