# Creating Additional Pages

In order to create a full featured site, sometimes you need to do a little bit
of repetitive work. You already know how to do it, so let's create the additional pages that we'll need for our site.

## The "Lunar Guides" Page

1. In the main menu, go to *Navigation* for *The Lunar Resort*.

2. Click on the menu button for *Public Pages* and select *Add Public Page*.

3. Enter "Lunar Guides" for the *Name*.

4. Select *3 Columns* for the layout.

5. Click *Add Page*.

## The "Book a Trip"" Page

1. Back in the main menu, go to *Navigation* for *The Lunar Resort*.

2. Click on the menu button for *Public Pages* and select *Add Public Page*.

3. Enter "About Us" for the *Name*.

4. Select *3 Columns* for the layout.

5. Click *Add Page*.

## Arranging pages

While viewing your pages, you can rearrange the order by dragging and dropping them in the main navigation. Rearrange your pages to match this order:
