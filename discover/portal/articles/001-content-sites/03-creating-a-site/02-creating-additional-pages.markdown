# Creating Additional Pages

<div class="learn-path-step">
    <p>Creating A Site<br>Step 2 of 6</p>

The Lunar Resort needs two more pages: 

-   Lunar Guides: A page that lists the guides employed by the Lunar Resort.
-   Book a Trip: A page for booking a trip to the Lunar Resort.

You'll create these pages using the same steps you used to create the existing 
pages. 
<!-- 
Double-check the page layouts for these pages to make sure they're as intended, 
and not just copied over from the earlier instructions.

## Arranging Pages

The new pages now appear in the navigation bar alongside the other pages. If 
these pages are out of your preferred order, you can rearrange them via drag and 
drop. Rearrange the pages to match this order:

Great! Now that you have your site's pages, you'll add some applications to 
them.
