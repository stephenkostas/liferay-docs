# Creating Content

So far you've created the outline of your site. Using basic page creation and 
templates you created layouts and the basic page structure of your site. Now 
it's time to color everything in with content.

In this section you'll create more basic content, create web content structure 
and templates to make more complex content, and use Liferay's Web Experience 
Management to display your new content on your site.
