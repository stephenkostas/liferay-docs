# Creating Basic Content

Earlier we created some basic content without a lot of context. Now you have 
the context of how and where you're creating content in the site. Next, use the 
same principles you used to create content for the front page to create some
articles for the *About Us* page.

On the *About Us* page you'll add some brief information about the Lunar Resort 
and other related Space Program initiatives.

## Creating the About Us Page Content

For the next content that you're adding, you'll use a slightly different method.
Earlier you created through Site Administration and then added it to a page. You
can also create content displays on pages where you want the content, and then 
add the content directly in place.

1. Go to the *About Us* page.

2. Open the *Add* menu.

3. Add a *Web Content Display* to each of the three columns.

4. Click the '+' button in the Web Content Display on the left side and select
    *Basic Web Content*.
