# Review Your Site

You create the pages, you created the content, and you organized and displayed 
it all using Liferay's Web Experience Management tools. It's time to take a 
step back and look at your site.

Now that you have the main content completed, your next step will be to use 
Liferay's Collaboration tools, like Blogs, the Calendar, and Message Boards to
connect more powerfully with your users.
