# Using Documents and Media

@product@'s Documents and Media features provides tools for uploading, 
organizing, and displaying various types of documents and images. You can use
it for collaborating on files like text documents or spreadsheets, managing 
collections of images, or simply use to store the images you reference in your
web content. In fact, you already have a few files in your Documents and Media
Library -- the images that you uploaded as part of the document creation 
process.

## Adding Files

Previously you added files directly in the Web Content creation process. This 
is a quick way do manage images, but it limits your organizational options and
in many case, you want to upload an image that is not related to a Web Content
article. Now let's add some new files that we'll need later to your Documents 
and Media.

1. Open the main menu.

2. Go to *The Lunar Resort* &rarr; *Content* &rarr; *Documents and Media*.

3. Click the `+` button and select *Add Multiple Documents*.

Here you can either drag files into the box in your browser or click *Select
Files* to open a file manager window to select files. You can also add 
categorization or description information to all the files at once on this page.
If you use the *Add Basic Document* option, you can add one file at a time and
add information to that file by itself.

3. Using your preferred method, add the `moon-image1.jpg`, `moon-image2.jpg`,
    and `moon-image3.jpg`. 
    
4. Click *Publish*.

Just like that you've successfully added files to your library. You'll use those
in a minute to create some content, but first we should probably organize all 
of these files a little better.

## Adding Folders

The root folder of your Media Library is getting a little crowded. Before you 
do anything else, you should create a bit more organization so that content 
creators and administrators have an easier time finding any documents that 
they're looking for.

1. Click the `+` button and select *Folder*.

2. On the next screen, for the *Name* enter "Web Content Images", and for the
    *Description* enter "Images used in Lunar Resort Web Content."

3. Click *Save*.

Back in the main Documents and Media page, you now have a folder available. 
Folders can be used for basic organization, and also for managing access to 
files through permissions.

Let's add another folder to go with the other images you uploaded.

1. Go back to the root folder of Documents and Media.

2. Repeat the steps from above to add another Folder.

3. Name the folder *Frontpage Images*.

## Organizing Media

To add files to folders, select the files that you want to move using, and drag 
them to the folder. Do that now:

1. Check the boxes for the `lunar-resort.png`, `space.png`, and 
    `space-program.png` currently in the root folder of the Documents
    and Media library.
    
2. Drag and drop the files to the folder you created.

3. On the next screen, you can change which files are included or their 
    destination, leave everything the same and click *Move*.

Note: You just moved some files that were currently in use, so you might be 
concerned that you'll need to update any references. Liferay keeps all of those
connections up to date behind the scenes, so you'll never need to update web
content because you moved an image.

4. Repeat these steps to add the remaining files in the root folder to 
    *Frontpage Images*.
