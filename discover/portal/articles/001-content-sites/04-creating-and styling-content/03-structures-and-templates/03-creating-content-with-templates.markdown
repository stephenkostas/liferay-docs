# Creating Content With Structures and Templates

You created the Structure which defines the data fields that a user will 
provide to create content. Then you created a Template which provides the
structure and layout for those fields. Now you need to fill out those data fields to create content.

## Creating Content With Custom Types

1.  Open *Site Administration* &rarr; *The Lunar Resort* &rarr; *Web Content*.

2.  Click the `+` button in the bottom corner.

3.  Select *Lunar Guides List*

Does this form look familiar? It's all of the fields that you defined when you
created the Structure.

4.  Set the Title as "Choose Your Lunar Guide:"

5.  Enter the names respectively for all of the guides - Cody, Jim, Russ, and 
    Steve.

6.  Select the appropriate image for each guide from the images that we updated 
    earlier.

7.  Click Publish.

Now the content is completed, but you still need to publish it on a page.

8.  Go to the Lunar Guides page.

9.  Open the *Add* menu and select *Content*.

10.  Drag the *Lunar Guides* content to the page.

Now you can test the content to see how it works. Clicking on each picture or 
name will link to that guide's page in the hierarchy.
