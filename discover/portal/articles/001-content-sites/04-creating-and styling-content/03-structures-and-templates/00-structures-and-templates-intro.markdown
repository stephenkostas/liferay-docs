# Web Content Structures and Templates

In @product@, you can create new web content types and layouts using Structures
and Templates. A Web Content Structure defines the type of items that will be in
your content, and the template applies the necessary styles and logic to those 
items.

The Structure is based on Liferay's Forms functionality. You use it to 
provide a list of the types of data that will in the new web content types, 
including text, images, calendar items, radio or checkboxes, links, and many
other types of data. Whatever fields you determine will define that web content
article type, and you'll be able to fill them in when you create the content.

The Template is Freemarker or Velocity based and enables you to use the provided
data to create complex or interactive content. The template can contain CSS, 
HTML, Javascript, and elements of the templating language you're using.

So far, you've actually been using a completed web content Structure/Template
combination - Basic Web Content is based on the same principles that you'll
use to create something a little more intricate.
