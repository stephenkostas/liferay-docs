# Setting up @product@

The Liferay Basic Configuration has several options. First, you can configure 
you Portal Name, the name and email address of your default Administrator. You 
can also configure the Default Language as well as if you want to autogenerate 
sample data for demo purposes. Finally, you can configure your database here. Let's start configuring!

1. Set the *Portal Name* to "The Lunar Resort".

2. If you prefer to work in a language other than the system default, change the
    *Default Language* to your preferred language.

2. Enter your name and email address for the *Administrator User*. The *Email* 
    will also serve as the user name for signing in.
    
3. Uncheck the box labeled *Add Sample Data*.

4. Click Finish Configuration.

    continue.
    
6. Create a password, and then click *Save*.

7. Finally, choose a security question and answer to complete the setup.

After you finish the startup, you are brought to the *Welcome* page. If you see 
the screen below, you have successfully set up your Liferay server. Now let's go over some Liferay basics.
