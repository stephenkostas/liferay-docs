# Basic Liferay Administration

Before you can do anything in Liferay, it will help to have a quick tour of
where everything is and what all the icons mean. We'll cover some of the most
common interface elements that you interact with while managing sites and
creating content.

There are four icons that run across the top of the page which you will need to use
for most administrative functions. The icon on the far left opens the main menu
which gives you access to the Control Panel and Site Administration.

When you click on *Menu*, a dynamic menu with a variety of options from content
creation to server configuration will pop out.

The set of three icons on the right side give you access to other options

* *Page Configuration* allows you to mange settings for the page setup and 
    display.

* *Add* opens the menu for adding content and applications to the current page.

* The *Simulator* allows you to view your page as it would display at different 
    resolutions like those common for tablets or smartphones.

The last important element to be aware of is the Portlet Bar. When you 
mouse-over an application on a page it's portlet bar will appear. You can click 
on the portlet bar to drag it around the page, or you can open the configuration
menu on the right side.

All of these options are only available to you because you're an administrative 
user. If you log out, all of the portlet bars and menu options are gone. If 
this all seemed like a whirlwind tour, don't worry. By the time you're finished
this will all seem like second nature. Now, on to content creation!
