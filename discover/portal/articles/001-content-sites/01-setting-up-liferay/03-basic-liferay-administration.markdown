# Basic Liferay Administration

    <p>Setting up Liferay<br>Step 3 of 3</p>

Before doing anything in @product@, you need to learn its basic UI. This article 
gives you a guided tour of the most common UI elements that you'll interact with 
while managing sites and creating content. 

For most administrative functions, you'll use the four icons that run across the 
top of the screen. Clicking the icon on the far left opens the main menu, which 
gives you access to the Control Panel and Site Administration. 
<!-- 
Instead of individual images, provide a labeled screenshot of the entire top bar
that contains the 4 icons

The main menu contains a variety of options for content creation, server 
configuration, site administration, and more. Clicking on *Control Panel* will 
open various administration functions for users, sites, and server 
configuration. Below that, you can manage your personal user information. Your 
regular site management and content creation tasks, where you'll be spending 
most of your time in this exercise, are found under the name of the site.

Returning to the bar that runs across the top of the screen, the three icons on 
the right give you access to options for the current page:

-   **Configure Page:** lets you mange page setup and display settings.
-   **Add:** opens the menu that lets you add content and applications to the 
    page.
-   **Simulation:** lets you preview your page at different sizes and 
    resolutions, like those common for mobile devices.

The final UI element to be aware of is the *portlet bar*, which appears when you 
mouse-over an application on a page. To reposition an application on the page, 
click and drag its portlet bar. You can also open the application's 
configuration menu by clicking the icon on the right side of the portlet bar.

Note that all of these options are only available to you because you're an 
administrator. Upon logging out, the menu options and portlet bars disappear. 
Don't worry if you don't understand all this. By the time you're finished with 
this Learning Path, @product@'s UI will be second nature. Now you're ready to 
create some content!
