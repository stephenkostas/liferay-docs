# Setting Up @product@

To get started, you must first set up your @product@ instance. This section 
shows you how to do this. You'll set up a portal called *The Lunar Resort*, 
which you'll later add content to. As you create the content for this 
hypothetical resort on the moon, you'll see why @product@ is well-suited for 
creating websites that are truly out of this world.
