# Creating Basic Web Content

As soon as @product@ is installed, you have all the tools you need to build
sites and create content. This means you can start right away! The first thing
to learn is the tool into which your creative juices flow: @product@'s content
editor. 

To do this, you'll first create a static piece of web content, and then in
a second step, you'll publish it. In five or ten minutes, you'll already have
a good idea how content creation works in @product@. What's stopping you?
