So far, you've manually published most of your site's content. Now you'll use 
[content display pages](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/publishing-assets#content-display-pages) 
to publish content automatically. @product@'s Asset Publisher app makes this 
possible. You can configure the Asset Publisher to automatically publish any 
type of asset (e.g., images, blogs, web content). A content display page is 
simply any page that contains an Asset Publisher app configured to display the 
page's associated content. Because the Asset Publisher is highly configurable, 
you can create a content display page that displays one or many pieces of 
content. 

First, you'll create a simple content display page for displaying a single piece 
of content. 

## Creating a Content Display Page [](id=creating-a-content-display-page)

Follow these instructions to create the content display page:

1.  In the *Menu* 
    (![Product Menu](../../../images/icon-menu.png)), open *The Lunar Resort* 
    &rarr; *Navigation*. 

2.  Click the *Options* button 
    (![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) next to *Public Pages* and 
    select *Add Public Page*. 

3.  Name the page *Hazard Disclaimer*. 

4.  Set the *Hide from Navigation Menu* toggle to *YES*. This hides the page 
    from the main navigation, meaning that users can only access the page 
    directly via a link. This means that to the user, the page is synonymous 
    with its content. 

5.  In the *Type* selector, select *Templates* &rarr; *Content Display Page*. 

6.  Set the *Inherit Changes* toggle to *NO*.

7.  Click *Add Page*. 
 
Nice! Now you're ready to create the page's content. 

## Creating the Display Page's Content [](id=creating-the-display-pages-content)

Use these steps to create the page's content:

1.  In the *Menu* 
    (![Product Menu](../../../images/icon-menu.png)), select *The Lunar 
    Resort* &rarr; *Content* &rarr; *Web Content*. 

2.  Click the *Add* icon 
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) at the bottom-right of the page and 
    select *Basic Web Content*.

3.  Name the content *Hazard Disclaimer*. 

4.  In the *Content* field, enter the following:

        Potential Hazards of Space Travel and Lunar Exploration include but are not limited to:
        
        Accidental ejection from airlock into the cold vacuum of space
        Spacesuit failure
        Spacecraft engine explosion
        Running and jumping so fast that you achieve escape velocity and are no longer bound by the moon's gravity
        Accidental exposure alien spores or eggs
        Collisions with stray meteorites
        Excess exposure to solar radiation
        Muscular atrophy
        
        Neither the The Space Program, The Lunar Resort nor any of the their subsidiaries are responsible for injury or harm caused by these or similar accidents.

5.  Open the *Display Page* section and click *Choose*.

6.  Select the *Hazard Disclaimer* page, and click *Done*.

7.  Click *Publish*. 

Awesome! Now that your content exists on the display page, you'll configure a 
link to it so that users can view it. 

## Using Content Display Pages [](id=using-content-display-pages)

You'll display the content via a link in an Asset Publisher. To do so, follow 
these steps: 

1.  Go to the *Book a Trip* page and use the *Add* menu 
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) to add an Asset Publisher app 
    to the page. 
<!-- This is a 3 column page... which column? -->

2.  Click the Asset Publisher's title (just beneath the portlet bar that appears 
    on mouse-over) to edit it and change it to *Waivers and Disclaimers*. 

3.  Open the Asset Publisher's *Configuration* dialog. 

4.  Under *Asset Selection* choose *Manual*. 

5.  Open the *Asset Entries* section and click *Select* &rarr; *Basic Web 
    Content*. 

    ![Figure x: Selecting individual content for display.](../../../images/001-select-basic-web-content.png)

8.  Select *Hazard Disclaimer*. 

9.  Click *Save*. 

10. Still in the Asset Publisher's *Configuration* dialog, click the *Display 
    Settings* tab. 

11. In *Asset Link Behavior*, select *View in Context*. 

12. Click *Save* and then close the configuration dialog. 

A summary of your content now appears in the Asset Publisher, with a link that 
takes you to the content display page containing your full content. The content 
display page also provides a friendly URL to your content that you can share. 
<!-- Where's the friendly URL? The URL looks rather menacing. -->

![Figure x: Your content now appears in the asset publisher.](../../../images/001-view-disclaimer.png)

Right now, you're using the content display page's default configuration. You 
can also configure the page to look however you want, or turn an existing page 
into a content display page. That's what you'll do next.
