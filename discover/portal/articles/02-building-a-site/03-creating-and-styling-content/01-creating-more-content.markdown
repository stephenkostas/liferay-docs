    <p>Creating Content<br>Step 1 of 7</p>
</div>

Earlier we created some content without knowing where it would go. Now you have
the context of how the site is organized. Next, use the same principles for
creating content on the front page to create articles for the *About Us* page.

On the *About Us* page, you'll add information about the Lunar Resort and other
related Space Program initiatives.

## Creating the About Us Page Content [](id=creating-the-about-us-page-content)

Recall that you created the Welcome page's content in Site Administration and 
then added it to the page. You'll use a slightly different method to create the 
About Us page's content. Specifically, you'll use the Web Content Display app 
to create the content directly in that app. 

1.  Go to the *About Us* page. 

2.  In the portlet bar of the left column's Web Content Display app, click the 
    *Add* button 
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-portlet-add-control.png)) and select *Basic 
    Web Content*. This takes you to the app's web content creation page. The 
    content you create here only appears in this app, on this page. 

    ![Figure x: You can create basic web content directly in the Web Content Display app.](../../../images/001-content-on-page.png)

2.  Enter the following information for the following fields:

    - **Title:** The Lunar Resort
    - **Summary:** Information about the Lunar Resort
    - **Content**: The Lunar Resort is an all-inclusive, one of a kind vacation 
    spot with attractions and activities unlike anything you've ever seen or 
    done before.

3.  With your cursor still in the Content field one line below the text you 
    just entered, click the plus button and select the image icon. Select 
    `lunar-resort-logo.png`. 
    <!--Where do I find this?-->

4.  Resize the image if necessary, then click *Publish*.

The Web Content Display app in the left column now contains your content. 

To add content in the remaining Web Content Display apps, repeat the above steps 
for each app but add different information in step two, and a different image in 
step three. 

1.  Add this for the Web Content Display app in the middle column: 

    - **Title:** The Space Program
    - **Summary:** Information about the Space Program
    - **Content:** The Space Program is our parent company and contains our 
    research, development, and exploration divisions. You can learn more about 
    the Space Program here. 
    - Add the image `space-program-logo.png`. 

2.  Add this for the Web Content Display app in the right column: 

    - **Title:** S.P.A.C.E.
    - **Summary:** Information about S.P.A.C.E.
    - **Content:** The Space Program Academy of Continuing Education 
    (S.P.A.C.E.) is the Space Program's educational wing. You can visit its 
    lunar campus during your Lunar Resort stay. 
    - Add the image `space-logo.png`. 

Great! The About Us page is now complete and provides all the information that 
the Lunar Resort's visitors need.

Next, you'll learn how to use @product@'s Documents and Media features to manage 
files in your portal.
