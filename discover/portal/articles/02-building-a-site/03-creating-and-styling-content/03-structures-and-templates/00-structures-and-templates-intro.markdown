In @product@, you can use *structures* and *templates* to create new web content 
types and layouts. A structure defines the type of items in your content, such 
as text, images, calendar items, checkboxes, links, and more. Structures are 
based on @product@'s forms functionality. When creating content based on a 
structure, you must fill out that structure's fields. 

A template uses a templating language to display a structure's items, so you can
apply styles and logic to create complex or interactive content. You can create
templates in [FreeMarker](http://freemarker.org/) or
[Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/). Templates can contain CSS, HTML,
JavaScript, and elements of the templating language it uses. 

Before getting started with structures and templates, you should know something 
important: you've actually already used them! Basic Web Content is a type of web
content defined by a structure and a template. Now you'll use structures and
templates to create something a little more intricate.
