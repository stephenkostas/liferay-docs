Now that you have a template for your structure, you can use that structure to 
create content. Remember, the template formats the structure's content for 
display.

Follow these steps to create your content: 

1.  Open the *Menu* 
    (![Product Menu](../../../../images/icon-menu.png)) and select *The Lunar 
    Resort* &rarr; *Content* &rarr; *Web Content*. 

2.  Click the *Add* icon 
    (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) at the bottom-right of the page 
    and select *Lunar Guides List*. This takes you to the New Web Content form 
    for your structure. Note that the fields and field groups you defined in the 
    structure are all here.

3.  For both *Title* fields, enter *Choose Your Lunar Guide*. Don't worry about 
    the duplication. The first Title field is default for all web content.
    You'll use the Web Content Display app to show only your structure's title
    field. This lets you use the template to style the field's content, rather
    than apps that display web content. 

4.  Fill out a field group for each lunar guide: *Cody*, *Jim*, *Russ*, and 
    *Steve*. For each *Image* field, select the guide's image from the images 
    you uploaded earlier. For each *Link to Page* field, click *Select* to open 
    the dialog that lets you select a page in your site. In this dialog, click 
    *Lunar Guides*, select the guide's page, and click *Select*. 
<!-- These images weren't included in the earlier upload instructions -->

5.  Click *Publish*.

The content now exists, but you must still publish it on a page in your
site. Follow these instructions to do so:

1.  Go to the *Lunar Guides* page.

2.  Click the *Add* icon 
    (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) at the top-right of the page 
    and expand *Content*. 

3.  Drag the content *Choose Your Lunar Guide* to the page. This displays your 
    content in a Web Content Display app. 

4.  Note that your content contains duplicate titles. You'll fix this now. Click 
    the Web Content Display app's *Options* button 
    (![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) and select *Look and 
    Feel Configuration*. In the *General* tab, select *Barebone* for 
    *Application Decorators*, then click *Save*. The only title that remains is 
    the one you defined in your structure and styled in your template. 

5.  Now you can test the content to see how it works. Click a guide's picture 
    or name to go to that guide's page in the hierarchy. 

Great! Next, you'll learn how to integrate JavaScript into your templates.
