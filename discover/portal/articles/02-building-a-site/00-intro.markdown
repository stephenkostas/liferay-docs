# Building Websites with Liferay Web Experience Management [](id=building-websites-with-liferay-web-experience-management)

Nowadays, few people build websites using only a text editor because that still
requires a lot of effort. Why do it manually when you can have the computer do
a lot of the work for you? With Liferay Web Experience Management, you can focus
on your site and let @product@ handle those low-level details. It provides web
content management, document management, and a framework for robust content
display and advanced content creation. With so many features, it's tough to know
where to start. This is a step by step guide to creating content, pages, and
sites, starting with the most basic elements and ending with a full-featured
website.

You'll start by creating simple content in an empty @product@ bundle. As you
progress, you'll add more complex content using @product@'s full suite of tools.
These tools include web content display, asset publisher, content display pages,
web content structures and templates, page templates, application display
templates, and more.
