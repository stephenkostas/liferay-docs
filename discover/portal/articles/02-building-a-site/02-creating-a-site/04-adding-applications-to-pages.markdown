All of a widget page's functionality comes from widgets. This functionality can 
be as simple as displaying content, or as complex as social networking. You 
create your page's functionality by adding widget to the page. You'll get 
started by adding widgets to the Activities and About Us pages. 

## The Activities Page [](id=the-activities-page)

You'll add two Asset Publisher widgets to display different assets, like
images, web content articles, or any other kind of content in @product@. Follow
these steps to add two Asset Publishers to the page:

1.  Navigate to the *Activities* page. 

2.  Click the *Add* button 
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) on the upper right and expand the 
    *Applications* &rarr; *Content Management* category in the menu. 

3.  Drag and drop one Asset Publisher to the page's right column and the other
    to the page's left column.

## The About Us Page [](id=the-about-us-page)

To add functionality to the About Us page, you'll add several Web Content 
Display widgets. Recall that this widget displays web content. 
You saw it in action when you displayed basic web content in the previous 
section of this Learning Path. Follow these steps to add Web Content Display to 
the About Us page: 

1.  Navigate to the *About Us* page.

2.  Click the *Add* button 
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) on the upper right and expand the 
    *Applications* category in the menu. 

3.  This time use the search bar to search for *web content display*.

4.  This page's layout has three columns. Drag and drop a Web Content Display 
    application into each column. 

As you can see, adding content and widgets to pages is a matter of drag and
drop. Next, you'll learn about page management and navigation.
