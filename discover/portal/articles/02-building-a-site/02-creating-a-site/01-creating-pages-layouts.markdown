Up to this point everything on the Welcome page stretches the width of the
entire page. You can control this with *page layouts*. For example, the Welcome
page has the simplest possible layout: one column. Any items in that column take
up its full width. You can place anything above or below but not to the side
of any existing item on the page. @product@ contains other layouts that arrange
items into different numbers of columns and rows. This gives you a great deal of
control over how applications and content appear in your site. 

You'll next use layouts to create the Activities and About Us pages for the
Lunar Resort.

## Creating the Activities Page [](id=creating-the-activities-page)

As you may be able to tell from the above screenshot, the Activities page uses
a two column layout with a small column on the left and a large column on the
right. Follow these steps to create this page:

1.  Open the main menu and expand the *Build* menu for *The Lunar Resort*. 

2.  In the Build menu, click the *Pages* button. 

3.  Click the *New* (![New Page](../../../images/icon-add.png)) button, then
    *Public Page* to add a new page.

4.  Select *Widget Page*

5.  Enter *Activities* for the *Name*, leave the box labeled "Add this Page to 
    the following Menus: Default" checked, and click *Save*.

    On the next page, you can set the page name, choose your layout, and set 
    several other options.

4.  For the layout, select *2 Columns (30/70)*. This sets the page to the two
    column layout. The smaller left column takes up 30% of the page, and the
    larger right column takes up 70% of the page.

5.  Leave the other options on their default settings and click *Save*. 

The Lunar Resort site now contains the Activities page. This page appears in 
the navigation, and you can add applications and content to it just as you 
would any other page. 

## Creating the About Us Page [](id=creating-the-about-us-page)

Now you'll create the *About Us* page. Note in the above screenshot that this
page has three columns. Follow these steps to create this page:

1.  From the *Pages* page, click the *New*
    (![New Page](../../../images/icon-add.png)) button, then *Public Page*.

4.  Select *Widget Page*

5.  Enter *About Us* for the *Name*, leave the box labeled "Add this Page to 
    the following Menus: Default" checked, and click *Save*.

    On the next page, you can set the page name, choose your layout, and set 
    several other options.

4.  For the layout, select *3 Columns*. This sets the page to the two
    column layout. The smaller left column takes up 30% of the page, and the
    larger right column takes up 70% of the page. 

5.  Leave the other options on their default settings and click *Save*. 

The navigation bar now contains the two new pages that you just created. Next,
you'll create a couple more pages and then arrange their order in the
navigation bar.
