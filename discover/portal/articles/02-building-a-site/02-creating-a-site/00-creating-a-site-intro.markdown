# Creating a Site [](id=creating-a-site)

Now that you've created basic web content, you're ready for something a bit more
intricate than a single page with a line of text and an image. In this part of
the Learning Path, you'll create more pages (including nested pages) and use
page layouts to customize how those pages show applications and content. You'll
also learn more about adding applications to pages and how to manage site
navigation.
