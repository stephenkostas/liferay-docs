The Lunar Resort needs one more page: 

-   Book a Trip: A page for booking a trip to the Lunar Resort.

Unlike previous pages which will use a variety of widgets to display content, 
the *Book a Trip* page will be a largely static page with marketing driven 
content and a button to direct customers to the booking process. To create this,
you'll use a Content Page. Content Pages are not created with layouts and 
widgets, but instead use Page Fragments created through collaboration by 
designers, developers, and marketers.

## Creating the Book a Trip Page [](id=creating-the-book-a-trip-page)

1.  Go to the *Build* &rarr; *Pages* page.

2.  Click *Add*  
    (![New Page](../../../images/icon-add.png)) then *Public Pages*. 
    
3.  On the next page, select *Content Page*.

4.  Enter *Book a Trip* for the *Name*, leave the box labeled "Add this Page 
    to the following Menus: Default" checked, and click *Save*.
    
5.  Click the *Back* button at the top left.

You don't have any Page Fragments created right now, so you'll need to come back
later to build the content on this page.
