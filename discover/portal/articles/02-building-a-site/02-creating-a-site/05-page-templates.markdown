As you've now seen, creating pages can be repetitive. Wouldn't it be great if
you could create multiple pages from a single template? Well guess what: page
templates in @product@ let you do exactly that! They also inherit future changes
to those pages. 

Now you'll use page templates in The Lunar Resort. First you'll create a page
template, then you'll use it to create several pages. Later, you'll make changes
to the template and see @product@ propagate those changes to the pages you
created from the template. 

## Creating a Widget Page Template [](id=creating-a-page-template)

Use these steps to create a page template:

1.  Open the Main Menu and go to *The Lunar Resort* &rarr; *Build* &rarr; 
    *Pages*.

2.  Select the *Page Templates* tab.
    
    Here you can create **Collections** which are like folders that can store
    any number of templates that you create for your site.

3.  First, click *New* to create a new collection.

4.  Enter *The Lunar Resort* for the *Name*, add a *Description* and click 
    *Save*.

5.  From the Lunar Resort collection page, click *Add*  
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) &rarr; *Widget Page Template* in the 
    upper right corner. This takes you to the page template creation page. 

6.  Name the template *Lunar Guide Page* and click *Save*.

This takes you to the new Widget Page Template which is currently empty. Next, 
you'll set up the new template.

## Editing a Page Template [](id=editing-a-page-template)

Editing a page template is similar to editing any page. You drag and drop
widgets onto the page and reposition or remove them as desired. The only
difference is that you can't directly add content, and some configuration and
display options are disabled (it's a template, after all). You can also see the 
Search and Navigation widgets which appear with the message "Configure this 
Application." Since the template does not exist in the context of the site, 
information from these cannot be displayed during template editing.
Follow these steps to edit the page template you just created: 

1.  Click the *Add* button 
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) on the upper right and expand the
    *Applications* &rarr; *Collaboration* category. Add a Blogs widget to the
    page template's right column. 
 
2.  Leave the page, and @product@ automatically saves your changes. 

Next, you'll create a page with this template. 

## Creating a Page with a Page Template [](id=creating-a-page-with-a-page-template)

Follow these steps to use the template to create a page: 

1.  Go back to *Pages* for *The Lunar Resort*.

2.  Click *Add* (![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) &rarr; *Public Page*.

3.  Select the *Lunar Guide Page* template.

4.  Enter *Cody* for the name.

5.  Uncheck the box to *Add this Page to the following Menus: Default* so that
    the page will not appear in the navigation menu.

6.  Click *Save*.

7.  Confirm the page information and leave *Inherit Changes* set to *Yes*. This 
    lets you edit this page in the future by editing the template, but removes 
    the ability to edit the page directly.

8.  Click *Add Page*.

9.  Cody is awesome, but he can't do everything by himself: repeat these steps
    to create pages for *Jim*, *Steve*, and *Russ*.

@product@ then creates the new page from your template. Note that none of these pages are not currently in the navigation menu. Next, you'll create a new Navigation Menu to handle just that.
