# Managing Pages With Navigation Menus

To change any aspect of your navigation in @product-ver@, you use Navigation 
Menus. With Navigation Menus you can create any number of custom menus which you can use to rearrange or nest pages in any fashion that you need.

## Rearranging Pages

To rearrange your pages,

1.  Open *Build* &rarr; *Navigation Menus* for *The Lunar Resort*.

2.  Click on the *Default* menu.

    The top to bottom order of the the pages listed here represents the left to right order when they are displayed in the default navigation.

3.  Click and drag the *About Us* page to the bottom of the list.

    Menus are updated as you make the changes, so you can leave the page after
    you make your changes.

You can create additional menus, but for now you'll move on to creating content
for the pages we already have.

Great! Now that you have your site's pages created and organized, you'll add 
some applications to them.
