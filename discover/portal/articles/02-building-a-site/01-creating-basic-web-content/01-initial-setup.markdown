Before you get any further you should set your site name. When you start a new 
Liferay bundle for the first time, it creates a site with a single "Welcome" 
page. The default name for the Site is "Liferay," but you can change that by 
changing the name globally. You can set the name through the Setup Wizard or 
through the Control Panel.

## Changing the Site Name [](id=changing-the-site-name)

Since you're working on the Lunar Resort website, and not Liferay's website, 
you should head over to the Control Panel to set your site name properly.

1. Open the Menu.

2. Click on *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration*

3. Select *Instance Settings*.

On the Instance Settings page, you can configure many aspects of your Liferay 
Instance, ranging from the site name and logo to authentication and email 
configuration. All you're concerned about today is the site name.

1. Under *General* &rarr; *Main Configuration* enter *The Lunar Resort* in the
    *Name* field.
    
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click *Save*.

3. Instantly, you should see that "The Lunar Resort" has replaced "Liferay"
    wherever the site name is referenced.

Now that we have that little bit of housekeeping taken care of, you can 
continue to create content and build your site!
