# Managing Liferay with Liferay Connected Services [](id=managing-liferay-with-liferay-connected-services)

![EE Only Feature](../../images/ee-feature-web.png)

Liferay Connected Services (LCS) is a set of online tools and services that lets 
you manage and monitor your Liferay Portal EE installations. While Liferay 
Portal's patching tool lets you apply fix packs and other updates, the install 
process is still manual. LCS simplifies this process by automatically installing 
any fix packs that you *choose*. That last point is an important one--LCS won't 
install anything that you don't specifically choose for installation. You still 
have control over what gets applied to your Liferay Portal installations. LCS 
just automates the process by enabling one-click downloading and updating. You 
can also use LCS to monitor the performance of your Liferay Portal instances. 
This includes data on pages, portlets, memory usage, JVM performance, and much 
more. Even better, the features of LCS work regardless of whether your Liferay 
Portal instance is on a single discreet server or distributed across a node. You 
can find more information about LCS on its 
[official product page](http://www.liferay.com/products/liferay-connected-services). 

Before going any further, you should make sure that your Liferay Portal 
instances meet the requirements for LCS--you must be running Liferay Portal 6.2 
EE. 

Also, you should take note of a few key terms used throughout this guide: 

- *Project*: Represents a group of users belonging to a company or organization. 
  For example, a project can consist of all the users from a project team or 
  business unit, or it can include the entire company.
- *Environment*: Represents a physical cluster of servers or a virtual or 
  logical aggregation of servers.
- *Server*: Describes a concrete portal instance. It can be a standalone server 
  or a cluster node.

As you go through this guide, you'll cover the following sections on LCS:

- LCS Preconfiguration
- Connecting to LCS
- Using LCS

You'll get started with the configuration steps required to use LCS with Liferay 
Portal.
