# Tracking App Performance [](id=tracking-app-performance)

One of the main reasons for developing and publishing apps on the Marketplace
is to drive downloads and adoption of your app. The Marketplace enables you, as
the developer of your app, to get detailed reports about the number of views,
downloads, and purchases of your app(s). To access these metrics, navigate
to *Home* &rarr; *Metrics* (under *Development*). 

![Figure 1: The App Performance view in Marketplace lets you see how many times your apps has been viewed, downloaded, and purchased over a time interval.](../../images/marketplace-app-metrics-over-time.png) 

The view shown above is the default metrics view for a single app. Across the
top is a list of data series options (*Views*, *Downloads*, or *Purchases*).
Below that, a date range can be chosen. In the middle, a graph is shown for the
data within the date range. Finally, the same data that is graphed is also shown
in tabular format, in case you want to know the exact values making up the
graph. The different types of data available to view are described below.

## Views

When someone searches or browses the Marketplace, they click on apps to see
detailed views of the apps they're interested in. When this occurs for your app,
a *View* is recorded for the app, and this data is what is shown on the App
Metrics screen when *Views* is selected at the top. *Views* is also the default
view, as shown above. The number of recorded views per day per user is
unlimited.

## Downloads

A download is recorded for your app when someone downloads a specific package of
a specific version of your app. The number of recorded downloads per day per
user is unlimited.

## Purchases

The Marketplace makes an effort to count the total number of purchases for your
app. 

Now that you understand how to publish your app and track its performance, let's
get a good understanding of Liferay Portal's Plugin Security Manager and the
security information you'll need to provide with your app.
