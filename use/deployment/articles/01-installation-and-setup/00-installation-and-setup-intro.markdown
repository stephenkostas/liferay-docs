#  Installation and Setup [](id=installation-and-setup)

Liferay Portal is one of the most flexible applications on the market today with
regard to application server environments. It supports a wide variety of
application servers, freeing you to use the Java application server you think is
best. Liferay also scales very well: you can install Liferay Portal on
everything from a shared hosting account to a multi-node cluster running a
commercial application server and on everything in between. In fact, Liferay is
used successfully in all of these scenarios every day.

You'll find that because Liferay is extremely flexible in its deployment
options, it is also easy to install. If you already have an application
server, you can use the tools for deployment that came with your application
server. If you don't have an application server, Liferay provides several
application server bundles from which to choose. These are pre-configured
application servers with Liferay already installed in them. They're very easy to
install and with a small amount of configuration can be made into
production-ready systems.

The installation steps vary slightly according to your Liferay edition, so we'll
be sure to let you know when they are different.
