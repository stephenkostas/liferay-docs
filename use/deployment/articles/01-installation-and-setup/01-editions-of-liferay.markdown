# Editions of Liferay [](id=editions-of-liferay)

Liferay ships in two editions: one for the community and one for enterprise
subscribers. The community edition is the same Liferay Portal that has been
available for years: frequently updated and bursting with the latest features,
the Community Edition of Liferay Portal is offered for free under the Lesser GNU
public license, a free software license with one important exception. This
license gives you the flexibility to link Liferay with your own code in your
portlet, theme, hook, layout, Ext or web plugins, no matter what license you use
for your code. If, however, you modify Liferay directly, those modifications
need to be released as free software under the terms of the license. The best
way, of course, to do this is to contribute it back to the Liferay community.
This is really the best of both worlds: you have the freedom use any license (or
no license) if you use plugins, but if you modify Liferay directly, the
community receives the benefits of any enhancements that you've made. 

Liferay for enterprise subscribers is a supported version of Liferay Portal for
the enterprise. The subscription and support package allows organizations to
build their portals on a stable version of the product that is offered over an
extended period of time. It's the best wayfor you to develop, deploy, and
maintain your Liferay solution. It includes 

- Liferay support
- Updates
- Fix Packs
- Cloud Services
- Liferay Portal Enterprise Edition
