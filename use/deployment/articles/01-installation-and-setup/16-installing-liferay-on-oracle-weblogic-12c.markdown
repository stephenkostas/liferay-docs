# Installing Liferay on Oracle WebLogic 12c (12.1.2 and higher) [](id=installing-liferay-on-oracle-weblogic-12c-12-1-2-and-h)

In this section, you'll learn how to install Liferay on Oracle WebLogic 12c.
Since you're using Oracle WebLogic, you may be curious of Liferay's support of
XA transactions. Liferay doesn't require XA transactions, but it supports XA.
Let's get acquainted with how Liferay fits in with your current WebLogic
domain. 

For demonstration purposes, we'll assume *Liferay Home* is one folder above the
domain to which you will be installing Liferay.

For example, if your domain location is
`/Oracle/Middleware/user_projects/domains/base_domain`, then your Liferay Home
is `/Oracle/Middleware/user_projects/domains`.

For this section, we will use `$WEBLOGIC_HOME` to refer to your WebLogic
server's installation `/Oracle/Middleware`. 

Before you begin, make sure you have downloaded the latest Liferay `.war` file
and Liferay Portal dependencies from
[http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/additional-files](http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/additional-files).
The Liferay `.war` file is called `liferay-portal-[version].war` and
the dependencies file is called `liferay-portal-dependencies-[version].zip`.

These instructions assume you have already configured a domain and server and
that you have access to the WebLogic console.

If you still have the `mainWebApp` module installed, remove it first.

Let's get started by installing the `.jar` files Liferay needs.

## Dependency Jars

Liferay needs the `.jar` files contained in the Liferay Dependencies Archive and
the driver `.jar` file applicable for your database. We'll put them on your
domain's global classpath. 

1.  Navigate to the folder that corresponds to the domain to which you will be
    installing Liferay. Inside this folder is a `lib` folder. Unzip the Liferay
    Dependencies Archive to this folder so the dependency `.jar` files reside in
    the `lib` folder.

2.  If WebLogic does not already have access to the JDBC driver for your
    database, copy the driver to your domain's `lib` folder as well.

So far so good. Your `.jar` files are in place and ready for Liferay.

Let's proceed with configuring WebLogic.

## Configuring WebLogic

Let's make the following adjustments in your configuration to support using
Liferay:
- Set WebLogic Server's memory arguments.
- Set the maximum size for Java's permanent generation space.
- Set the file encoding.
- Enable Lucene support.
- Enable AspectJ support.

You can set WebLogic Server's memory arguments in your `setDomainEnv.[cmd|sh]`
environment script file found in your domain's `bin` folder. For the Sun JVM,
we'll set the WLS memory arguments for 64 bit and 32 bit architectures to
`-Xms256m -Xmx1024m` at a minimum. For all other JVMs, we'll set the 64 bit and
32 bit WLS memory arguments to `-Xms512m -Xmx512m` respectively. 

We'll set the permanent generation space for 64 bit and 32 bit architectures
to `-XX:PermSize=256m`.

Lastly, we'll make sure to specify UTF-8 for Java's file encoding, by
including `-Dfile.encoding=UTF8` as a Java property.

If you're on Windows, for example, you'd edit your `setDomainEnv.cmd` file and
find the call to the `commEnv.cmd` script. After this call, you'd update your
memory arguments and permanent generation space settings to be like the
following code: 

    ...
    if "%JAVA_VENDOR"=="Sun" (
        set WLS_MEM_ARGS_64BIT=-Xms256m -Xmx1024m
        set WLS_MEM_ARGS_32BIT=-Xms256m -Xmx1024m
    ) else (
        set WLS_MEM_ARGS_64BIT=-Xms512m -Xmx512m
        set WLS_MEM_ARGS_32BIT=-Xms512m -Xmx512m
    )
    ...
    set MEM_PERM_SIZE_64BIT=-XX:PermSize=256m
    set MEM_PERM_SIZE_32BIT=-XX:PermSize=256m

Later in the `setDomainEnv.cmd` file's clustering support section, you'd set
the UTF-8 file encoding by appending `-Dfile.encoding=UTF8` to the front of the
list of Java property values, as done in the following line of code: 

    set JAVA_PROPERTIES=-Dfile.encoding=utf8 %JAVA_PROPERTIES% %CLUSTER_PROPERTIES%

Next, we'll need to specify some local environment settings to support Liferay's
memory requirements, its use of the [Apache
Lucene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucene) search engine library, and its use
of Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) with
[AspectJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AspectJ).

Open the `startWebLogic.[cmd|sh]` file from within your domain's folder--NOT
your server's `bin` folder. If you're on Windows, you'd add directives similar
to those listed below, after the `SETLOCAL` command:

    set "USER_MEM_ARGS=-Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=512m"
    
    set "MW_HOME=D:\Oracle\Middleware\wlserver_12.1"
    
    set "JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -da:org.apache.lucene... -da:org.aspectj..."

Make sure to set your `MW_HOME` value to your WebLogic server's location. On
Linux, you'd make similar changes replacing `%JAVA_OPTIONS%` with
`$JAVA_OPTIONS`. 

Next, if you want to configure your database and/or mail session within
WebLogic, start your WebLogic server.

## Database Configuration

If you want WebLogic to manage your data source, use the following procedure. If
you want to use Liferay's built-in data source, you can skip this section.

1.  Select *Services &rarr; Data Sources.* Click *New &rarr; Generic Data
    Source*.

2.  Give your data source a name, such as *Liferay Data Source*. The JNDI name
    should be `jdbc/LiferayPool`.

3.  Choose the type of database and click *Next*. 

4.  Click *Next* three times. You should be on the *Connection Properties*
    screen. Enter the database name, the host name, the port, the database user
    name and the password. WebLogic uses this information to construct the
    appropriate JDBC URL to connect to your database. Click *Next*.

5.  WebLogic prompts you to confirm the information you've specified for your
    data source. 

    Depending on the database you are using, you may need to specify additional
    parameters. For example, you may need to modify your JDBC URL to include
    additional parameters. If you need to access previous wizard pages to modify
    information, click *Back* to revisit those pages. 

    When you're done specifying your configuration, click *Next*. 

6.  Click *Test Configuration* to make sure WebLogic can connect to your
    database successfully. When it does, click *Finish*.

7.  You will be back to the list of data sources. Notice your new data source
    has no value in the *Target* column. Click on your data source to edit it.

8.  Click the *Targets* tab and check off the server instance(s) to which you
    wish to deploy your data source. Then click *Save*.

Next, let's configure a mail session in WebLogic.

## Mail Configuration

If you want WebLogic to manage your mail sessions, use the following procedure.
If you want to use Liferay's built-in mail sessions, you can skip this section.

1.  Select *Mail Sessions* and create a new mail session which points to your
    mail server.

2.  Give it the name *Liferay Mail* and give it the JNDI name of
    `mail/MailSession` and click *Next*.

3.  Choose your server and then click *Finish*.

Now let's make sure Liferay can access this mail session.

## Domain Configuration - Continued

Let's revisit domain configuration to make sure we'll be able to access your
data source and mail session from Liferay Portal.

1.  Create a `portal-ext.properties` file in your Liferay Home folder.

    If you are using *WebLogic* to manage your data source, add the following to
    your `portal-ext.properties` file to refer to your data source:

        jdbc.default.jndi.name=jdbc/LiferayPool

    If you are using *Liferay Portal* to manage your data source, follow the
    instructions in the *Deploy Liferay* section for using the setup wizard.

    If want to use *Liferay Portal* to manage your mail session, you can
    configure the mail session in the Control Panel. After starting your portal
    as described in the *Deploy Liferay* section, go to *Control Panel &rarr;
    Server Administration &rarr; Mail* and enter the settings for your mail
    session.

    If you are using *WebLogic* to manage your mail session, add the following
    to your `portal-ext.properties` file to reference that mail session:

        mail.session.jndi.name=mail/MailSession

2.  Lastly, you must provide WebLogic a reference to a version of Java Server
    Faces (JSF)--either version 1.2 or 2.0--to use that library. Open the
    `WEB-INF/weblogic.xml` found in your Liferay Portal `.war` file. Insert the
    following deployment descriptor after the `<context-root>` element within
    the `<weblogic-web-app>` element. Make sure to specify the applicable JSF
    version:

        <library-ref>
            <library-name>jsf</library-name>
            <specification-version>1.2</specification-version>
            <implementation-version>1.2</implementation-version>
            <exact-match>false</exact-match>
        </library-ref>

Before we deploy Liferay, we'll teach you how to enable and configure Java
Security so that you can start using Liferay's plugin security manager with
the Liferay apps you download and install. 

## Security Configuration

When you are ready to start using other people's apps from Marketplace, you'll
want to protect your portal and your WebLogic server from security threats. To
do so, you can enable Java Security on your WebLogic server and specify a
security policy to grant your Liferay Portal access to your server. 

First, let's grant Liferay access to your server. For now, we'll open up all
permissions--you can fine-tune your policy's permissions later. Create a policy
file named `weblogic.policy` in your `$WEBLOGIC_HOME/wlserver/server/lib` folder
and add the following contents:

    grant {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
    };

To enable security on your WebLogic server and direct the server to your policy
file, open the `setDomainEnv.[cmd|sh]` file in your domain's folder. Then set
the `-Djava.security.manager` Java option and set the property
`-Djava.security.policy==` to the location of your `weblogic.policy` file. You
can specify both settings on the same line like this:  

    -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy==$WEBLOGIC_HOME/wlserver/ser\
    ver/lib

The double equals sign tells the app server to use this policy file on top of
any existing security policies.

documents at
[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/spec/security-spec.doc.html](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/spec/security-spec.doc.html).
Also, see section [*Understanding Plugin Security
Management*](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/understanding-plugin-security-management-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-11-en)
in Chapter 12 of the Developer's Guide to learn how to configure Liferay plugin
access to resources. 

Now its the moment you've been waiting for: Liferay deployment!

## Deploy Liferay

This section provides instructions for deploying Liferay to your application
server domain.

Now, let's deploy Liferay Portal.

1.  Start your WebLogic server if it's not already started.

2.  Select *Deployments* and click the  *Install* button. Upload the desired JSF
    `.war` file--`jsf-1.2.war` or `jsf-2.0.war`--from WebLogic's common
    deployable libraries folder and select *Install this deployment as a
    library* to your domain's server that will be running Liferay. 

3.  After installing the JSF libraries, go back to deployments and select the
    Liferay `.war` file from the file system or click the *Upload Your File(s)*
    link to upload it and then click *Next*.

4.  Select *Install this deployment as an application* and click *Next*.

5.  If the default name is appropriate for your installation, keep it. Otherwise,
    give it a name of your choosing and click *Next*.

6.  Click *Finish*. After the deployment finishes, click *Save*.
    Liferay precompiles all the JSPs and Liferay launches.

Congratulations! You are now running Liferay on Oracle WebLogic 12c.
