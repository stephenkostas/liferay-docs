# Advanced Portal Operation [](id=advanced-portal-operation)

In this chapter we discuss several advanced features of Liferay Portal,
including audit trails and portal maintenance, backup, and logging. We also
discuss how to remotely access Liferay's web services. Audit trails allow portal
administrators to track the activities of portal users--this can be very useful
for troubleshooting or figuring out who's responsible for certain actions that
have taken place on your portal. It's generally not much more complicated to
maintain a running Liferay instance than it is to maintain the application
server upon which it's running. However, Liferay provides tools for logging,
patching, and upgrading Liferay that you should know how to use.  It's also
important to follow secure backup procedures to protect your Liferay instance's
source code, database, and properties files.

We'll discuss the following topics in this section:

-   Audit Trails

-   Liferay Monitoring using Google Analytics

-   Backing Up a Liferay Installation

-   Changing Logging Levels

-   Patching Liferay

-   Upgrading Liferay

-   Sandboxing Portlets to Ensure Portal Resiliency

-   Using Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP)

-   Remotely Accessing Liferay Services

Let's get started with audit trails.
