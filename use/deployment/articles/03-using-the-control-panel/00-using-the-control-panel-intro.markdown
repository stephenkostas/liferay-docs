# Using the Control Panel [](id=using-the-control-panel)

In the previous chapter, we learned how to use the Control Panel for user
management. We learned how to manage users, organizations, user group, roles,
and password policies. We also learned about user monitoring. In this chapter,
we'll look at portal and server configuration options for Liferay. Now that you
have been navigating in the Control Panel, you should be pretty familiar with
how it works. The Control Panel is organized in four main areas: Users, Sites,
Apps, and Configuration. The options in the *Configuration* section of the
Control Panel category include configuration options which control how the
portal operates and integrates with other systems you may have.  In this
chapter, we'll cover the following topics:

- Portal settings, such as user authentication options, mail host names, email
  notifications, identification settings, and display settings 

- Custom fields

- Server administration options, including options for resources, log levels,
  properties, CAPTCHA, data migration, file uploads, mail, external services,
  scripts, and shutdown settings

- Portal instances

After you have created users, user groups, organizations, roles, sites, and
teams your portal will be ready to host content and applications. You can
configure Liferay's portal settings to fit your environment and your particular
portal project. It's easy to adjust configuration settings using the
portlet-driven user interface of Liferay' Control Panel. Let's start by
examining Liferay's Portal Settings.
