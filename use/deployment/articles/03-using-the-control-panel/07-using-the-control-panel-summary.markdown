# Summary [](id=summary-14)

In this chapter, we examined how to configure Liferay's portal settings. We
looked at the different authentication options provided by Liferay. You can
configure Liferay so that users can authenticate via LDAP, CAS, Facebook, NTLM,
OpenID, OpenSSO, or SiteMinder. We also examined some general configuration
options for the portal users, such as reserved credentials and default user
associations. 

Next, we learned how to configure mail host names, email notifications, content
sharing, identification information, and portal display settings. We showed how
to add custom fields to various portal entities such as users, pages, documents,
wiki articles, message board posts, and more. 

We also saw how to view and configure overall server settings. We saw how to
view the memory currently being used by the server, as well as how to initiate
garbage collection, a thread dump, search engine re-indexing and the clearing of
various caches. We learned how to debug parts of the portal by changing log
levels and by viewing the various properties defined in the portal. We learned
how to properly notify users that the portal is about to shut down and how to
set up external services like OpenOffice integration.

Lastly, we looked at how to create multiple portal instances on a single
installation of Liferay and we showed how to view currently installed plugins.
We hope this information helps you become an effective Liferay Portal
Administrator.
