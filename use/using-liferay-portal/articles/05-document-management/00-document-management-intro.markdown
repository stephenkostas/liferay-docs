# Document Management [](id=document-management)

Liferay's Documents and Media library provides a mechanism for storing files
online using the same type of structure that you use to store files locally. You
can use it to store files of any kind; it serves as a virtual shared drive, and
can mount and browse external repositories. Its companion portlet, the Media
Gallery, displays selected content from the Documents and Media library. It can
display image, audio and video files. Other features in the Documents and Media
library include customizable document types and metadata sets, automatic
document preview generation, and support for mounting multiple external
repositories. The new document types and metadata sets are an addition to, not a
replacement for, the portal's system of tags and categories. Let's start
exploring how to use the Documents and Media portlet.
