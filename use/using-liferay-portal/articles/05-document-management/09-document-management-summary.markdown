# Summary [](id=summary-3)

In this chapter, we examined Liferay's Documents and Media Library, a powerful
and customizable virtual shared drive. Liferay 6.1 introduced the ability to
mount multiple external repositories to the Documents and Media library. The
Documents and Media library can be used to store files of any kind. The
Documents and Media Display portlet is meant to be configured to show chosen
hierarchies of folders and files from the Documents and Media library. The Media
Gallery is meant for presenting media files such as images or videos. 

Document types and metadata sets provide a flexible way to distinguish between
different types of files and to define custom metadata fields for them. Document
previews are automatically generated by default, but Liferay supports
integration with external tools that offer greater speed, higher quality, and
additional functionality. Finally, we discussed Liferay Sync, an add-on product
for Liferay 6.1 that allows your Liferay server to directly synchronize files on
users' desktop and mobile environments.
