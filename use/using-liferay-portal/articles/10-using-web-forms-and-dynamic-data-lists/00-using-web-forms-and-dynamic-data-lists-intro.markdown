# Using Web Forms and Dynamic Data Lists [](id=using-web-forms-and-dynamic-data-lists)

As needs change in business and organizations, the technology used to fulfill
those needs must adapt as well. People use electronic means to do things that
years ago were done using manual processes. For example, you may want your team
to sign up on your web site for a holiday party. Or maybe every fall, you need
to put up a job posting board, only allowing administrators to create new job
posts. Maybe you want to allow users to manage a notebook or To-Do list on their
private pages. In all of these cases, you want to enter in custom sets of data,
allow your users to add their information, and be able to access the set of
data. 

In the past, you'd need to be a developer to accomplish any of this. Today, you
can do it without writing a single line of code. Enter Liferay's *Dynamic Data
Lists*. This is an easy way to create, aggregate, and display new data types.
Data Lists are flexible enough to handle all types of data, and you don't have
to write any code. Simply put, Liferay gives you the power to perform the
following actions:

- Define your own data definitions

- Create new lists from those definitions

- Customize the input forms for ease of use

- Customize the output format

- Integrate lists into Workflow 

All of this capability can be easily distilled into two concepts: data defining
and data displaying. These data lists are dynamic for a reason: they are
flexible and powerful. Whether you want to collect simple input from the user or
develop an entire data entry system for real estate listings, Dynamic Data Lists
have your use case covered. Combined with the flexibility provided through
templates and the power of languages like Velocity, entire applications can be
built in a short time.
