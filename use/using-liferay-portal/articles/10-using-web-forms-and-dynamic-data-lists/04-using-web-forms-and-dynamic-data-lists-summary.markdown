# Summary [](id=summary-8)

Our `list.it` experience is now much more enjoyable than when we first signed
up. As new Listies, we had no idea how to define our own data types for our
lists, let alone how to create a list. You can now be the envy of your
co-workers as you breeze through list and data definition setup. Once you have
your new lists set up, you can work through building new, custom input forms for
the data. Your friends on `list.it` will thank you and wonder how you were able
to accomplish it all. That's nothing next to the masterpiece of design that you
can show off in your custom displays through display templates. Once the lists
have the precise look and feel you envisioned, then living among the Listies
will not only be easy, but fun and exciting.

With the ability to create dynamic sets of data and customize both the data
display as well as the entry, the possible combinations are limitless. Dynamic
Data Lists can be viewed as a way to deliver small-scale applications that
display desired information quickly. Whether you're building a site like
`list.it` or a real estate listing service, you'll find the limitless power of
dynamic data lists enticing, easy to use, and above all, empowering.
