# Summary [](id=summary-5)

In this chapter, we discussed personal sites for portal users. We showed how to
enable or disable them, how to set whether or not pages should be automatically
created, and how to customize automatically created pages. We also examined
general customizable pages that don't belong to personal sites. Administrators
can designate certain pages or portions of pages to be customizable and site
members can configure these portions of the pages, add or remove portlet
applications, and save their configurations.

We also discussed how you can use Liferay's rules engine with Liferay EE. As you
can see from the Sample Rules portlet, using a rules engine can be a powerful
way to decouple the rules of your application from the front-end and back-end
code. These rules are written in a declarative language that business users can
read and verify. Additionally, rule definitions can be modified without
modifying the underlying Java code, re-compiling, or redeploying your
applications.
