# Summary [](id=summary-1)

This chapter has been your guide to advanced Liferay site management and web
content management. We've seen how you can use Liferay to manage both simple
content and advanced content with structures and templates. We've also learned
how to use page and site templates to simplify the site creation process.

Liferay WCM also includes a powerful staging environment, allowing you to stage
content locally on the same server or remotely to another server. You can
publish your site when you want it, on the schedule you choose. You can even
create different variations of your site that can be worked on simultaneously.

Site administrators can allow users to create personal customizations of site
pages. We discussed how site administrators can create teams as a flexible means
of delegating site permissions. We also saw how to configure mobile device rules
so that site pages are presented differently depending on the device making a
page request.

Whether your site is small and static or large and dynamic, Liferay's WCM
enables you to plan and manage it. With tools such as the WYSIWYG editor,
structures and templates, you can quickly add and edit content. With the Web
Content Display and Asset Publisher, you can rapidly select and configure what
content to display and how to display it. By using Liferay's integrated
workflow, you can set up custom publishing rules to fit your organization. And
by using Liferay's staging and scheduling mechanisms, you can manage various
branches of pages and content and control when they are published to your live
portal instance. You will find that managing your site becomes far easier when
using Liferay's Web Content Management system.
