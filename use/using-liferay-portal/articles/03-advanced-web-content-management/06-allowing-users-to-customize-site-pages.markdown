# Allowing Users to Customize Site Pages [](id=allowing-users-to-customize-site-pages)

As we discussed before, as your site becomes larger and more complex, management
of the content becomes more challenging. We've gone over Liferay management
tools that help you create content quickly and in an orderly fashion. You
created a simple announcement with Liferay's structure editor that allows you to
quickly design a structure and prepare it for the template designers. Then you
applied a template to the structure. You know how to display content using the
Web Content Display portlet. Now, you're ready to take advantage of Liferay's
advanced publishing options.

If a web site isn't properly managed, it can quickly become stale and that
drives viewers away. If people are finding your site because of search engines,
you don't want them presented with outdated (and possibly inaccurate) web
content. You also want your content to be found easily by your users. This is
done through tags and categories.

Additionally, you may want to create content and send it through an approval and
review process weeks before you want it displayed on the web site. Liferay gives
you this flexibility with the *Schedule* and *Workflow* features.
