# Creating Teams for Advanced Site Membership Management [](id=creating-teams-for-advanced-site-membership-management)

Teams allow site administrators a greater degree of flexibility than was
possible using just user groups and roles. They allow site administrators to
create various sets of users and permissions for site-specific functions. Teams
are the preferred method for collecting permissions within a single site.

If you create a team for one site, the permissions defined for it are not
available to any other sites. In contrast, if you assigned a custom role to a
user group, the role would be available portal-wide even though the specific
permissions defined by it would only apply within the scope of a designated
site. Furthermore, team members, unlike user group members, are guaranteed to be
members of the desired site.

To create a team within a site, first navigate to the Site Administration page
of your site and select *Users* &rarr; *Site Teams*. It's important to note that
configuring other site membership groupings, such as *Users*, *Organizations*,
and *User Groups* can be found in the *Site Memberships* portlet, which is also
located in the Users tab. You can visit the *Management* chapter for more
information on how these site memberships. Finally, click the *Add Team* button.

After you've clicked the *Add Team* button and entered a name and a description,
click *Save*. Your new team will appear in the list. To add members, simply
click on *Actions &rarr; Assign Members*.

Permission management for teams is configured by navigating to *Actions* &rarr;
*Permissions* for your individual site. Setting permissions for the team assigns
every member of the team with equal permissions. Only administrators with the
ability to edit/manage the team have the ability to manage team permissions.

That's it! Now your team is ready to perform their functions. Next, let's look
at how to configure Liferay for mobile devices.
