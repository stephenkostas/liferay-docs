# Scheduling Web Content [](id=scheduling-web-content)

Liferay's WCM lets you define when your content goes live. You can determine
when the content is displayed, expired and/or reviewed. This is an excellent way
to keep your site current and free from outdated (and perhaps incorrect)
information. The scheduler is built right into the form your users access to add
web content. Specifically, it can be found in the right panel listed with
several other configurable settings.

**Display Date:** Sets (within a minute) when content will be displayed.

**Expiration Date:** Sets a date to expire the content. The default is one year.

**Never Auto Expire:** Sets your content to never expire.

**Review Date:** Sets a content review date.

**Never Review:** Sets the content to never be reviewed.

As you can see, the scheduling feature in Liferay Portal gives you great control
in managing when, and for how long, your web content is displayed on your web
site. Additionally, you have the ability to determine when your content should
be reviewed for accuracy and/or relevance. This makes it possible to manage your
growing inventory of content.

Similar to scheduling, Liferay's staging feature also allows you to manipulate
time, in a manner of speaking.
