# Summary [](id=summary-10)

In this chapter, we examined several Liferay utility applications: the Bookmarks
portlet, the Shopping portlet, the Software Catalog, the Reports and
JasperReports applications, and the Knowledge Base. The Bookmarks portlet allows
users and administrators to collect and share useful link to pages either within
or outside of the portal. The Shopping portlet allows you to use PayPal to set
up your portal for E-commerce activity. The Software Catalog allows you to
define a set of software items to make available to visitors to your portal.
Remember that the Software Catalog has been replaced by Liferay Marketplace. If
you want to use it, you'll have to manually install it as a plugin. The Reports
application is an EE-only application that provides a Reports Admin portlet in
the Control Panel for creating reports and scheduling report generation. When
combined with a suitable implementation, such as the JasperReports application
(also EE-only), you can upload report definitions in the Reports Admin portlet,
generate reports, and export reports to a wide variety of formats. The Knowledge
Base application is an EE-only application that allows you to create articles
and organize them into full books or guides that be published on your portal.
The Weather portlet provides users with a summary of weather-related information
for multiple locations and provides a links to [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/)
for more detailed information for each location. Next, let's take a tour of the
Liferay Marketplace and learn how to manage Liferay plugins.
