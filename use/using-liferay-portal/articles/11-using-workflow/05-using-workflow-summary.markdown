# Summary [](id=summary-9)

In this chapter, we explained how to install the Kaleo workflow plugin for
Liferay EE. Liferay's Kaleo workflow engine is included with Liferay CE. We
discussed how to create new workflow definitions and examined the XML schema
for them. We looked at how to choose different workflow processes for different
asset types. We also explained how end-users can interact with the approval
process. Finally, we discussed how to use workflow with different types of
applications such as Documents and Media and Dynamic Data Lists. In the next
chapter, we'll look at Kaleo forms and the Kaleo workflow designer.
