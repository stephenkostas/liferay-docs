# Using Workflow [](id=using-workflow)

Liferay Portal includes a workflow engine called Kaleo. In Greek, Kaleo 
means "called ones," which is appropriate for a workflow engine that calls users
to participate in a process designed for them. Kaleo workflow allows a user to
define any number of simple to complex business processes/workflows, deploy
them, and manage them through a portal interface. The processes have knowledge
of users, groups and roles. You don't have to write a single line of code to
accomplish this: all you have to do is create one XML document. And if
you're a Liferay EE customer, you get a graphical workflow designer which gives
you a point and click interface to create workflows. 

To explain how to use Kaleo Workflow, this chapter covers: 

- Enabling workflow

- Creating workflow definitions

- Configuring assets to use workflow process definitions

- Using workflow with other applications

Once we're done with this chapter, you should be familiar with how to use
Liferay's Kaleo workflow to set up approval process for any kind of content
before it is published to your portal.
