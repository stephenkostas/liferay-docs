# What is Liferay? [](id=what-is-liferay)

Let's attempt some mind reading: you're reading this book because you need to
build a website. You're thinking about using Liferay Portal for your site, or
you've already decided to use it and you want to learn all about it. Either
way, you've come to the right place. What you'll find here is that Liferay
Portal is the right decision, and we'll be happy to tell you all the reasons
why. But since you might be in a rush, we'll give you all the reasons in a
nutshell right here, and then you can read the details in the rest of the
chapter. 

The reasons to use Liferay Portal for your website are simple: it provides a
robust *platform* to serve your site to all clients, be they desktop, mobile, or
anything in between; it provides all the standard *applications* you need to run
on your site; and it provides an easy to use development *framework* for new
applications or customization. In addition to this, Liferay Portal is developed
using an open source methodology, by people from around the world. The code base
is solid, and has been proved to be reliable and stable in mission critical
deployments in diverse industries. 

But don't just take our word for it. Let us *show* you how Liferay does all
this. Probably the first thing you want to do after you install Liferay Portal
to manage your site is to get your content published. Let's dive right in and
see how Liferay Portal handles that task.
