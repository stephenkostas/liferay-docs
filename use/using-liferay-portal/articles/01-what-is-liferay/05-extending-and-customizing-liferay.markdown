# Extending and customizing Liferay for your own needs [](id=extending-and-customizing-liferay-for-your-own-needs)

Beyond using Liferay as a development platform for new applications, Liferay
Portal has also been designed to be extended and modified. As an open source
project, its source code is available, but Liferay Portal's developers have
designed the product to make it easy to build whatever you want out of it. 

The first (and easiest) way of customizing parts of Liferay Portal is with
Application Display templates. These let you change the way built-in
applications look. For example, if you don't like the Documents and Media
Library's file manager view with large icons, you can create an Application
Display template that shows documents in a list view. If you don't like the
layout of the Blogs portlet, you can change it so that it has the look you want. 

Liferay Portal goes far beyond this, though. Special software components called
*hook* and *ext* plugins enable developers to change any aspect of Liferay's
interface and behavior--without having to modify any of Liferay Portal's source
code. This provides you all the benefits of building your site from scratch, but
without all the effort to actually build from scratch. If you want to make a
change to the user registration screens, add support for a proprietary single
sign-on mechanism that you've written, add a feature to the message boards
application, or anything else, you can make those customizations. And if you're
a developer, we're sure you know that it's a whole lot easier to customize
something that almost does things exactly the way you want than it is to write
that feature from scratch. With Liferay Portal, you *can* have your cake and eat
it too.
