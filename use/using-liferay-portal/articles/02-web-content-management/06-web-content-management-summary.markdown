# Summary [](id=summary-0)

This chapter has provided an introduction to Liferay site management and web
content management. We've learned how you can use Liferay to create multiple
sites with different membership types. We've seen how easy it is to create and
manage sites and to create and manage pages within a site in Liferay. We've also
seen how easy it is to create and edit web content using Liferay's rich WYSIWYG
editor. This powerful tool enables users who don't have much experience with
HTML and CSS to easily create and style web content of any type that you'd like
to publish on the web. 

Liferay WCM also includes a powerful workflow engine, allowing you to set up
custom publishing rules to fit your organization. You can set up custom approval
processes for different sites as well as for different kinds of content within a
site. We'll examine sites in more detail in chapter 3. We'll also cover some
more advanced web content management tools such as web content structures and
templates, page templates and site templates, staging, and mobile device rules.
