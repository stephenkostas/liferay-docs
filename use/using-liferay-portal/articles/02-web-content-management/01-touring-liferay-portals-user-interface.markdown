# Touring Liferay Portal's User Interface [](id=touring-liferay-portals-user-interface)

Liferay Portal's user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive. Across
the top is what's known as the *Dockbar*, a series of links that appear based on
the permissions of the logged-in user. There are four sections in the Dockbar:
*Admin*, *My Sites*, *Notifications*, and the *User* section. 

The Admin section gives you access to Liferay Portal's Site Administration
interface, as well as to the Control Panel. Both of these are explained in more
detail later in this book. Site administration in particular can be done
directly on the page as well, as will be described.

The My Sites section provides a list of the sites which the logged-in user can
access. These appear as a drop down list. Next are Notifications. The
Notifications icon shows the unread notifications you have. You are
notified upon receiving a private message, an invitation to join a site, a
social connection request, or an event reminder. Alerts and announcements
created via the Alerts or Announcements applications are accessible via the
Notifications icon.

Finally, the user section shows the users name and provides links to the user's
profile (his or her publicly-accessible pages), dashboard (his or her private
pages), account settings, and a sign out link. 

On the left side of the page are three icons: one for add, one for previews, and
one to show or hide the edit controls if you have administrative access to the
page. All of these are explained later in this chapter. 

Anything else you see on the page is provided by the theme that is installed.
This includes site navigation and application windows, called *portlets*. Let's
jump in and start creating the site we'll use for this book.
