# Summary [](id=summary-6)

We have explored many of the portlets in Liferay's collaboration suite. The
Blogs and Blogs Aggregation portlets can be used to manage shared blogs or blogs
belonging to a group of people at once. These portlets have all the features you
would want in a blog, including rich text editing, links to news aggregators,
tags, RSS feeds, and more.

The Calendar portlet, likewise, can be used to manage a shared calendar or a
group calendar. It includes features for events, event notification, repeatable
events, and import and export to and from the standard iCalendar format.

Discussion becomes easy with Liferay's Message Boards portlet. This portlet can
be used to manage heavily trafficked discussion forums with ease. It inherits
all of the security features of the Liferay platform and includes
administrative functions for thread priorities, moving threads, nested
discussion categories, banning users, and more.

Liferay's Wiki portlet is a state of the art wiki application that users can
make use of to collaborate on web pages. Again, it inherits the strengths of
the Liferay platform in the form of security, interface, and search. You can
use the wiki portlet to manage several wiki nodes or use many wiki portlets to
manage one node each.

The Polls portlet is a fun way to interact with users of your site to get an
understanding of what they're thinking at any given time. It allows you to
create multiple choice polls that keep track of the votes and display results
on the page. You can view these results in a number of ways, including charts.

The Announcements portlet allows administrators to create and manage
announcements and allows users to view the announcements. The announcements can
be sent via email or text or they can simply be displayed on the portal. The
Announcements portlet provides a good way for administrators to communicate to
different groups of users since each announcement can be scoped to a specific
site or role.

Liferay provides a chat solution for your portal that's very easy to use. It
allows logged-in users to see who else is logged in to the portal and view
their status. Users can go invisible if they don't want others to know that
they're online. Users can chat with each other via instant messages. You can
also set up a Jabber chat server and configure Liferay to use it; this allows
users who have logged in to your portal via their browsers to chat with users
using traditional desktop clients.

Integrating mail with your portal is easy with the Mail portlet. You can add as
many custom or Gmail mail accounts as you wish, and this portlet can keep them
all organized in one place, together with the rest of the things Liferay is
aggregating for you.

Liferay's collaboration platform is a full suite of integrated applications
that empower users to work together. You can use them to great effect to
enhance your portal and to build a vibrant, active community.
