# Collaboration Suite [](id=collaboration-suite)

Liferay Portal ships with a robust suite of collaboration applications which
you can use to build communities of users for your site. These applications
provide all the features that you would expect of standalone versions outside
of a portal setting. The difference with Liferay's collaboration suite,
however, is that all of the applications share a common look and feel, security
model, and architecture. They inherit the strengths of being part of Liferay's
development platform so you can use them in combination with Liferay's user
management and content management features to build a well-integrated,
feature-rich web site.

This chapter focuses on how to use Liferay's collaboration suite. We explain
how to set up and administer:

-   Blogs
-   Calendars
-   Message Boards
-   Wikis
-   Polls
-   Announcements
-   Chat
-   Mail

Let's jump right in and begin by exploring Blogs.
