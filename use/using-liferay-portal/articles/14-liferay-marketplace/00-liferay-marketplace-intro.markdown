In a nutshell, the Liferay Marketplace is a repository for applications built on
the Liferay Platform. You can find and download applications directly from the
Marketplace on the web or use an existing Liferay installation to access and
install applications onto the running Liferay web site. Once installed, you can
manage the applications through Liferay's Control Panel.
