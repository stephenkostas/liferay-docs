# Finding Apps [](id=finding-apps)

There are several ways to search for and find apps you are interested in.

1. Browsing Categories: Click on a category (for example, *Communication* or
   *Productivity*) to see a list of interesting apps in that category. Upon
   clicking a category, you are presented with a list of featured apps for that
   category, as well as a canonical listing of all apps. Also, on the right, are
   lists of the Most Viewed apps within that category.

2. Searching: To search for an app, type in search criteria in the search box
   under the navigation menu on the left and click *Search*. Apps matching the
   specified search criteria are displayed.

Next, let's talk about app versioning.

## Versions

Apps are often updated to include new features or fix bugs. Each time an app is
updated, its version number is changed. The version number is specified by the
app developer and often follows established norms, such as 1.0 &rarr; 1.1 &rarr;
2.0 or 1.0.1 &rarr; 1.0.2 &rarr; 1.2.0 and so on. Generally, the higher the
numbers, the newer the version.
 
When viewing an app's details, click on the *Version History* tab to see a list
of versions of the app. In some cases, not all historical versions of apps are
available, depending on the app. Usually, you will want to download and install
the latest available app for the version of Liferay you are using (See
Compatibility below).
 
## Compatibility

Some apps are written to work across a wide range of Liferay Platform releases.
Others are dependent on a specific Liferay Platform release (or a handful of
such releases). When viewing individual apps, each version of the app that is
available also describes the range of Liferay Platform versions the app is
compatible with. Make sure to choose a version of the app that is compatible
with your Liferay Platform release.

To check if an app is compatible with your version of Liferay, click on the App
and then click on the *Version History* tab. The Version History tab displays
not only the list of versions of the app but also the app's supported framework
versions and the dates of each version of the app. The supported framework
version of the app tells you whether or not the app is compatible with your
version of Liferay.
