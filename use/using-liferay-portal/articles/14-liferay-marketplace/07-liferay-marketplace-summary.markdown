# Summary [](id=summary-11)

In this chapter, we introduced Liferay Marketplace, your one-stop shop for
browsing and downloading Liferay-compatible applications. We looked at how to
browse, purchase, download, and install apps. You can do this either through
[liferay.com/marketplace](liferay.com/marketplace) or through Liferay Portal's
Control Panel. When you purchase apps, you can do so via your personal account
or on your company's behalf. For information about developing and uploading apps
to Liferay Marketplace, please see the Marketplace chapter of the Liferay
Developer guide at
[http://www.liferay.com/marketplace/developer-guide](http://www.liferay.com/marketplace/developer-guide).

After discussing Liferay Marketplace, we discussed general plugin management. We
covered Liferay portlet plugins as well as layout, theme, hook, Ext, and web
plugins. Finally, we looked at how to manually deploy plugins to Liferay and
discussed some configuration issues.
