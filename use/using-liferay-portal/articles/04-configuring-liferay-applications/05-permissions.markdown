# Permissions [](id=permissions)

All of Liferay's portlets support Liferay's robust, fine-grained permissions
system. Some higher level permissions can be configured in the permissions tab
of the portlet configuration dialog box. You can grant roles permission to add
the portlet to a page, configure the portlet, or view the portlet. To set these
permissions, go to the *Configuration* menu and click on *Permissions*. This
shows you a table of roles defined in the portal. Use the check boxes to grant
certain permissions to different roles. Click *Save* after you've made your
selections. 

Beyond this, specific permissions are generally defined for specific
applications. For example, the message boards portlet contains a *Ban User*
permission. This makes no sense in the context of another portlet, say, the
blogs portlet. We'll go over permissions for specific applications in the
sections for those applications. For now, let's move on to sharing
applications.
