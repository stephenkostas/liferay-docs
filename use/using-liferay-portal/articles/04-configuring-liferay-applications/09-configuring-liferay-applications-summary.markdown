# Summary [](id=summary-2)

In this chapter, we explored the configuration options available for Liferay
applications. We showed how to customize your applications, export/import
portlet data, take advantage of different scopes, and communicate between
portlets. We also examined the different uses of social applications like
Facebook and Netvibes for your Liferay applications. Besides the general
configuration options, we also explored the Recycle Bin. This feature is a
special file directory allowing users to browse, retrieve, or permanently delete
recycled content. In all, Liferay gives you an abundance of options to leverage
the full capability of your applications.
