# Archived Setups [](id=archived-setups)

Once you've configured a portlet, Archived Setups enables you to save those
settings in an "archive". If someone goes in and changes the settings of a
particular portlet, it then becomes easy to revert those changes back to the
original, archived configuration.

To create an archived setup, click the *Configuration* option from the menu in
the portlet's title bar. If the current settings of the portlet you're
configuring are the ones you want to archive, click the *Archive/Restore Setup*
link. If not, change and save the settings until you have the portlet
configured the way you want it, and then click the *Archive/Restore Setup*
link.

There is only one field to fill out. Enter a name for your archive and click
*Save*. You should now see your archive in the list. If you ever need to revert
the portlet to these archived settings, you can click *Actions &rarr; Restore*
next to the archived setup you want to restore.

Unless otherwise noted, all of the portlets in this chapter support this
feature. This is particularly useful for portlets that have a lot of
configuration options, such as the Message Boards portlet. 

Next, we'll see how permissions apply to Liferay portlets in general.
