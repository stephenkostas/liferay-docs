# Social Networking [](id=social-networking)

Since the first social networks rose to popularity, concepts such as *Friend*
and later *Like*--previously reserved for direct human interaction--have taken
on new meaning in an always-online, information driven culture. It could be
argued that social networks have transformed the way people interact with their
friends, relatives and colleagues. Friends, connections, followers, circles and
lists have enabled people to connect and stay connected in ways they'd never
been able to before. Initially, these concepts proved to be highly successful
for casual web sites but they didn't take to the business world as quickly. But
many organizations are now realizing the importance of leveraging social
interactions for more than just recreation. Liferay's robust social features
make it a great platform for business web sites, casual web sites and everything
in between.

Social applications have many differences when compared to Standard applications
that are vital to a social networking site. Standard applications have general
and user specific data, whereas social applications can share data within a
defined network. This variation is a huge advantage when trying to communicate
important information to a large group of people. This difference in
communication settings is illustrated below:
