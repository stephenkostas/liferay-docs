# Integrating with Facebook [](id=integrating-with-facebook)

Facebook is currently the number one social network in the world with somewhere
over 1 billion active users. If you're trying to build acommunity on your 
portal, you don't want to neglect a bridge to that many possible users. With 
that in mind, Liferay provides a few easy ways for you to integrate your portal 
with Facebook.

## Facebook Sign On 

Like many web sites you may visit, any portal running on Liferay can be set up
to use Facebook for sign in. This makes it easier for users to sign in to your
site, since they won't need to remember another user name and password, For more
information on setting up Facebook sign on, see chapter 15.

## Using your Portlets as Facebook Applications 

You can add any Liferay portlet as an application on Facebook. To do this, you
must first get a developer key. A link for doing this is provided to you in the
Facebook tab in any portlet's Configuration screen. You will have to create the
application on Facebook and get the key and canvas page URL from Facebook. Once
you've done this you can copy and paste their values into the Facebook tab. Your
portlet is now available on Facebook.

This integration enables you to make things like Message Boards, Calendars,
Wikis, and other content on your portal available to a much larger audience
(unless you already have a billion users on your site, in which case, kudos to
you).
