# Working Smarter with Liferay Social Office [](id=working-smarter-with-liferay-social-office)

Liferay Social Office is Liferay's social collaboration product for the
enterprise. Previously released as a separate product that was based on Liferay
Portal, it's now available as an application that can be installed on Liferay.
We are excited to bring both Social Office and this guide to you, in the hope
that you'll be able to use each to enable your teams to work together more
efficiently. This guide is for those who are setting up and administering an instance of
Liferay Portal using Social Office. From installing Social Office to introducing
you to its entire feature set, we'll discuss all of the things you can do with
Social Office to help your team. We hope you'll use it as a tool to get Social
Office up, running, and integrated into your enterprise. You can find much more
information about installation and administration in *Using Liferay Portal*

"Help!"

This has been the cry of information workers everywhere who have tried to manage
complex projects through email and shared folders. You've probably had a similar
experience: you're collaborating on a document with a team of people and are
emailing it back and forth. Person A creates the initial document and Person
B replies with some edits. Person C replies with additional edits at the same
time Person A replies with the corrections from Person B. Person D takes this
and rewrites a whole section of the document while Person B and C respond to
Person A's update. Pretty soon, it becomes very difficult to determine which
document is the latest document. The same scenario plays itself out when working in shared folders,
except there's no trail of email messages to figure out who did what and when.

The Social Office plugin for Liferay Portal is designed to answer this call for
help. Social Office is a dynamic team collaboration solution for the enterprise that's
designed to streamline communication, save time, and raise productivity.
Organizations and groups can use Social Office to share resources, collaborate
on projects, and raise the visibility of important activity. We created the product 
to provide a simple, out of the box solution for team collaboration. Social Office provides
you with a fantastic array of features that you don't need to spend a lot of
time configuring. It's ready to use right out of the box. Once installed, a 
quick setup wizard will help you set up a team collaboration site so you can begin working 
immediately. In fact, you can have a full production environment set up in
less time than it takes to brew a pot of coffee.
