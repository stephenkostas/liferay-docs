# Writing a Data-Driven Application [](id=writing-a-data-driven-application)

One of the most common ways to store data in an application is to use a
database. If you've followed the introductory learning path, you learned how to
write a Liferay application using only the simple API for portlet preferences.
While that method allows you to create some simple applications, it doesn't
scale well, and the amount of data you can store is limited. This learning path
picks up where that one left off: here, you'll learn how to turn the Guestbook
into a full-fledged, database-driven application.
