Liferay's learning paths provide an in-depth, from-the-ground-up guide to using
Liferay's development framework. Beginning with installing a Liferay development
environment, you'll learn everything in a step-by-step fashion from writing a
Liferay application, to customizing Liferay Portal, to distributing your
application in Liferay Marketplace. 

These guided tutorials are called Learning Paths since they are designed to be
followed from beginning to end. Following them all provides a great introduction
to developing on Liferay's platform. When you've finished following Liferay's
learning paths, you'll be prepared to dive into the more in-depths topics found
in the tutorials.
