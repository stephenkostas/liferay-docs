# Creating a User Interface [](id=creating-a-user-interface)

It's time to create the Guestbook Admin portlet's user interface. The default
view of the portlet should have a button for adding new guestbooks. It should
also display a list of all the guestbooks that have already been added to the
current site.

![Figure 1: The Guestbook Admin portlet allows administrators to add new guestbooks or to edit existing guestbooks, configure their permissions, or delete them.](../../images/guestbook-admin-portlet.png)

Each guestbook's name should displayed along with an Actions button. The Actions
button should display options for editing the guestbook, configuring its
permissions, or deleting it.

## Creating JSPs for the Guestbook Admin Portlet's User Interface

You'll use three JSPs to construct the Guestbook Admin portlet's user interface:
one for the default view, one for the Actions button, and one for the form for
adding or editing a guestbook.

Use the following steps to create the Guestbook Admin portlet's user interface:

1. Edit your guestbook-portlet project's `docroot/html/guestbookadmin/view.jsp`
   file and replace its default contents with the following JSP code:

        <%@include file="/html/init.jsp"%>

        <aui:button-row cssClass="guestbook-admin-buttons">
                <c:if test='<%= GuestbookModelPermission.contains(permissionChecker,
                     scopeGroupId, "ADD_GUESTBOOK") %>'>
                        <portlet:renderURL var="addGuestbookURL">
                                <portlet:param name="mvcPath"
                                        value="/html/guestbookadmin/edit_guestbook.jsp" />
                        </portlet:renderURL>
                
                        <aui:button onClick="<%= addGuestbookURL.toString() %>"
                                value="Add Guestbook" />
                </c:if>
        </aui:button-row>

        <liferay-ui:search-container>
                <liferay-ui:search-container-results
                        results="<%= GuestbookLocalServiceUtil.getGuestbooks(scopeGroupId,
                                                        searchContainer.getStart(),
                                                        searchContainer.getEnd()) %>"
                        total="<%= GuestbookLocalServiceUtil.getGuestbooksCount(scopeGroupId) %>" />

                <liferay-ui:search-container-row
                        className="com.liferay.docs.guestbook.model.Guestbook" modelVar="guestbook">

                        <liferay-ui:search-container-column-text property="name" />
                        
                        <liferay-ui:search-container-column-jsp
                            path="/html/guestbookadmin/guestbook_actions.jsp"
                            align="right" />
                
                </liferay-ui:search-container-row>

                <liferay-ui:search-iterator />
        </liferay-ui:search-container>

    First, you include the `init.jsp` file since the pattern you're following
    specifies that all JSP imports go there.

    Next, you add a button row with a single button for adding new guestbooks:
    `<aui:button-row cssClass="guestbook-admin-buttons">`. The `cssClass`
    attribute allows you to specify a custom CSS class that can be used for
    additional styling. Note the use of the `<c:if>` tag. If the current user
    does not have permission to add new guestbooks, the button does not appear.
    If the user does have permission, the `<portlet:renderURL>` tag is used to
    construct a URL that points to the `edit_guestbook.jsp`. You haven't created
    this JSP yet, but you'll use it for both adding a new guestbook and editing an
    existing one.

    The final part of the `view.jsp` file contains the Liferay search container
    construct that's created by the `<liferay-ui:search-container>` tag. To make
    the search container display all the guestbooks from the current site, three
    sub-tags need to be added inside of it:
    `<liferay-ui:search-container-results>`,
    `<liferay-ui:search-container-row>`, and `<liferay-ui:search-iterator>`. The
    `<liferay-ui:search-container-results>` tag's `results` attribute uses a
    service call to retrieve a list of all the guestbooks from the current site.
    The `total` attribute uses another service call to get the total number of
    guestbooks in the current site.

    The `<liferay-ui:search-container-row>` tag determines the structure of each
    row of search container objects. You have to indicate the type of object in
    the list with the `className` attribute:
    `className="com.liferay.docs.guestbook.model.Guestbook"`. You also have to
    declare a variable to represent your Guestbook model:
    `modelVar="guestbook"`. Within the search container row, you are defining
    two columns with two subtags. The two subtags are different, since they're
    defining different types of columns. The
    `<liferay-ui:search-container-column-text property="name" />` tag specifies
    the first column. This tag is used for displaying text. Its
    `property="name"` attribute specifies that the text to be displayed is the
    `name` attribute of the current guestbook object. The
    `<liferay-ui:search-container-column-jsp`
    `path="/html/guestbookadmin/guestbook_actions.jsp" align="right" />` tag
    specifies the second, and last, column. This tag is used for displaying
    another JSP file within a search container column. Its `path` attribute
    specifies the path to the JSP file that should be displayed:
    `guestbook_actions.jsp`.
    
    Lastly, the `<liferay-ui:search-iterator />` tag is responsible for actually
    iterating through and displaying the list of guestbooks. Using Liferay's
    search container makes the Guestbook Admin portlet look like a native
    Liferay portlet. It also provides built-in pagination so that your portlet
    can automatically display large numbers of guestbooks on one site.

    Your next step is to add the `guestbook_actions.jsp` file that's responsible
    for displaying the list of possible actions for each guestbook.

2. Create a new file called `guestbook_actions.jsp` in your project's
   `docroot/html/guestbookadmin` directory. Then add the following code to it:

        <%@include file="/html/init.jsp"%>

        <%
                String mvcPath = ParamUtil.getString(request, "mvcPath");

                ResultRow row = (ResultRow) request
                                .getAttribute(WebKeys.SEARCH_CONTAINER_RESULT_ROW);

                Guestbook guestbook = (Guestbook) row.getObject();
        %>

        <liferay-ui:icon-menu>
                <c:if
                        test="<%=GuestbookPermission.contains(permissionChecker,
                                                                guestbook.getGuestbookId(), ActionKeys.UPDATE)%>">
                        <portlet:renderURL var="editURL">
                                <portlet:param name="guestbookId"
                                        value="<%=String.valueOf(guestbook.getGuestbookId()) %>" />
                                <portlet:param name="mvcPath"
                                        value="/html/guestbookadmin/edit_guestbook.jsp" />
                        </portlet:renderURL>

                        <liferay-ui:icon image="edit" message="Edit"
                                url="<%=editURL.toString() %>" />
                </c:if>

                <c:if
                        test="<%=GuestbookPermission.contains(permissionChecker,
                                                                guestbook.getGuestbookId(), ActionKeys.PERMISSIONS)%>">
                        <liferay-security:permissionsURL
                                modelResource="<%= Guestbook.class.getName() %>"
                                modelResourceDescription="<%= guestbook.getName() %>"
                                resourcePrimKey="<%= String.valueOf(guestbook.getGuestbookId()) %>"
                                var="permissionsURL" />

                        <liferay-ui:icon image="permissions" url="<%= permissionsURL %>" />
                </c:if>

                <c:if
                        test="<%=GuestbookPermission.contains(permissionChecker,
                                                                guestbook.getGuestbookId(), ActionKeys.DELETE)%>">
                        <portlet:actionURL name="deleteGuestbook" var="deleteURL">
                                <portlet:param name="guestbookId"
                                        value="<%= String.valueOf(guestbook.getGuestbookId()) %>" />
                        </portlet:actionURL>

                        <liferay-ui:icon-delete url="<%=deleteURL.toString() %>" />
                </c:if>
        </liferay-ui:icon-menu>

    In `guestbook_actions.jsp`, you are displaying a list of possible actions
    that can be performed on a guestbook: editing it, configuring its
    permsisions, or deleting it. As with all of your portlet's JSPs, you need to
    include `init.jsp`, since you're following the pattern of adding all JSP
    imports to one file. In order to get the particular guestbook selected by
    the user, you have to use the search container result row selected by the
    user. This is what you're doing in the initial scriptlet at the top of the
    file. You also need the `mvcPath` URL parameter for the *edit guestbook*
    action so the portlet knows the path to the form to display for editing a
    guestbook: `edit_guestbook.jsp`. Creating this JSP will be your last step.

    Most of `edit_guestbook.jsp` is taken up by the `<liferay-ui:icon-menu>` tag
    and its contents. The `<liferay-ui:icon-menu>` tag itself is a container for
    menu items. Note the use of the three `<c:if>` tags: each menu item is only
    displayed if the user has the appropriate guestbook permissions. The Edit
    menu item displays the Edit icon and the message *Edit*:

        <liferay-ui:icon image="edit" message="Edit"
                url="<%=editURL.toString() %>" />

    The `editURL` variable is created via the `<portlet:renderURL
    var="editURL">` tag with two parameters: `guestbookId` and `mvcPath`. The
    `guestbookId` parameter specifies the guestbook to edit (it's the one from
    the selected search container result row), and the `mvcPath` parameter
    specifies the path the the Edit Guestbook form.

    The Permissions menu item displays the Permissions icon and the default
    message *Permissions*:

        <liferay-ui:icon image="permissions" url="<%= permissionsURL %>" />

    The `permissionsURL` variable is created via the
    `<liferay-security:permissionsURL>` tag. You supply the model resource class
    name and the primary key of the specific resource for which you'd like to
    display the permissions configuration menu, and the tag does the rest.
    Another benefit of using Service Builder and defining your guestbook
    permissions in `docroot/WEB-INF/src/resource-actions/default.xml` is that
    your application seamlessly integrates with Liferay's permissions system.

    The Delete menu item displays a default delete icon and the default message
    *Delete*:
    
        <liferay-ui:icon-delete url="<%=deleteURL.toString() %>" />

    Unlike the `editURL`, which is just a render URL that displays the
    form for editing a guestbook, the `deleteURL` is an action URL. It invokes
    the portlet's `deleteGuestbook` action and you create it via the
    `<portlet:actionURL name="deleteGuestbook" var="deleteURL">` tag. This
    action URL only takes one parameter, the `guestbookId` of the guestbook to
    be deleted. Now there's just one more JSP file left to create: the
    `edit_guestbook.jsp` that contains the form for both adding a new guestbook
    and editing an existing one.

3. Create a new file called `edit_guestbook.jsp` in your project's
   `docroot/html/guestbookadmin` directory. Then add the following code to it:

        <%@include file = "/html/init.jsp" %>

        <%
                Guestbook guestbook = null;

                long guestbookId = ParamUtil.getLong(request, "guestbookId");

                if (guestbookId > 0) {
                        guestbook = GuestbookLocalServiceUtil.getGuestbook(guestbookId);
                }
        %>

        <portlet:renderURL var="viewURL">
                <portlet:param name="mvcPath" value="/html/guestbookadmin/view.jsp"></portlet:param>
        </portlet:renderURL>

        <portlet:actionURL name='<%= guestbook == null ? "addGuestbook" : "updateGuestbook" %>' var="editGuestbookURL" />

        <aui:model-context bean="<%= guestbook %>" model="<%= Guestbook.class %>" />

        <aui:form action="<%= editGuestbookURL %>" name="<portlet:namespace />fm">
                <aui:fieldset>
                                <aui:input type="hidden" name="guestbookId"
                                        value='<%= guestbook == null ? "" : guestbook.getGuestbookId() %>' />
                                <aui:input name="name" />
                </aui:fieldset>

                <aui:button-row>
                                <aui:button type="submit"></aui:button>
                                <aui:button type="cancel" onClick="<%= viewURL %>"></aui:button>
                </aui:button-row>
        </aui:form>

    You begin, of course, by importing `init.jsp`. Then you declare a `null`
    guestbook variable. If there's a `guestbookId` parameter in the request,
    then you know that you're editing an existing guestbook, and you use the
    `guestbookId` to retrieve the corresponding guestbook via a service call.
    Otherwise, you know that you're adding a new guestbook.

    Next, you create a view URL that points to the default view of the Guestbook
    Admin portlet. This URL is invoked if the user clicks *Cancel* on the Add
    Guestbook or Edit Guestbook form. After that, you create an action URL that
    invokes either the Guestbook Admin portlet's `addGuestbook` method or its
    `updateGuestbook` method. If no guestbook could be retrieved from the
    request, `addGuestbook` is invoked. Otherwise, `updateGuestbook` is invoked
    with the required parameter: the guestbook's `guestbookId`.

    If a guestbook is being edited, the current guestbook's name should appear
    in the name field of the form. You use the following tag to define a model
    of the guestbook that can be used in the AlloyUI form:

        <aui:model-context bean="<%= guestbook %>" model="<%= Guestbook.class %>" />

    The form itself is created with the following tag:

        <aui:form action="<%= editGuestbookURL %>" name="<portlet:namespace />fm">

    When the form is submitted, the `editGuestbookURL` is invoked, which calls
    the Guestbook Admin portlet's `addGuestbook` or `updateGuestbook` method, as
    discussed above. The name of the form is prefixed by the
    `<portlet:namespace>` tag, which results in a unique name for each portlet
    (or portlet instance). This guarantees that the form name is always 
    unique, regardless of the page to which it's been added.
    
    The `guestbookId` needs to appear on the form so that it can be submitted.
    The user, however, doesn't need to see it. Thus, you specify `type="hidden"`:

        <aui:input type="hidden" name="guestbookId"
                value='<%= guestbook == null ? "" : guestbook.getGuestbookId() %>' />

    The name, of course, should be editable by the user so it's not hidden.

    The last item on the form is a button row with two buttons. The *Submit*
    button submits the form, invoking the `editGuestbookURL` which, in turn,
    invokes either the `addGuestbook` or `updateGuestbook` method of the
    Guestbook Admin portlet. The *Cancel* button invokes the `viewURL` which
    displays the default view of the Guestbook Admin portlet.

Excellent! You've now finished creating the Guestbook Admin portlet. Test it
out! Try adding new guestbooks, editing guestbooks, configuring guestbook
permissions, and deleting guestbooks.
