# Using AlloyUI Form Validation

In a previous learning path, you created a form for users to submit when adding
an entry to a guestbook. You implemented a token form of back-end validation
(checking the entry name, email address, and message for `null` values) in the
service layer, but did not provide front-end validation in the form itself.
Before users submit your form, you should make sure that they have filled out
all of the required fields. Your front-end form validation should indicate which
fields are required and should highlight the required fields if the user tries
to submit the form with one or more of the required fields left blank. For email
addresses, your form validation should check that the user entered a valid
address. Your form validation should also allow you to restrict the number of
characters that can be entered into a field. The number of remaining characters
for the field should be displayed to the user. With AlloyUI, it's easy to
implement all of these form validation features. Once you've implemented form
validation, users' attempts to submit invalid forms will be caught by the
browser, before a request is sent to your Liferay server.

You'll implement form validation with AlloyUI in two steps. First, you'll use
the AlloyUI validator tag to specify required fields and fields that require a
special format (e.g., the email address field). Then you'll use the AlloyUI
Character Counter module to limit the number of characters that comprise a
guestbook entry message.

## Using the AUI Validator Tag

Validating AUI input fields is very easy. You just have to add an
`<aui:validator>` tag and specify the appropriate attributes.

Open your project's `docroot/html/guestbook/edit_entry.jsp` file.

To keep things simple, replace the contents between the `<aui:fieldset>` and
`<aui:fieldset/>` tags with the following code:

    <aui:input name="name" >
         <aui:validator name="required" errorMessage="Please enter your name." />
    </aui:input>

    <aui:input name="email" >
         <aui:validator name="email" />
         <aui:validator name="required "/>
    </aui:input>

    <aui:input id="message" type="textarea" name="message">
         <aui:validator name="required" errorMessage="Please enter a message." />
    </aui:input>

    <aui:input name='guestbookId' type='hidden' value='<%= ParamUtil.getString(renderRequest, "guestbookId") %>'/>

    <aui:input name="entryId" type="hidden" />

Save this update and redeploy your app.

You've added `<aui:validator>` tags inside of the `<aui:input>` tags
corresponding to the name, email, and message fields. The `<aui:validator>` tag
allows you to quickly and easily validate your fields. First, note that you must
add an `<aui:validator/>` tag inside of the `<aui:input>` tag for each field you
wish to validate. Next, note that you have to specify a value for the `name`
attribute. The value of the `name` attribute determines the type of validation
to apply to the field. You added an `aui:validator name="required" />` tag to
all of the non-hidden form fields. This prevents blank empty fields from being
submitted. For the email field, you've added an `aui:validator name="required"
/>` tag. This ensures that only valid email addresses can be submitted. 

In the code above, you also changed the message field from a text input field to
a textarea input field. This provides more space for users to enter guestbook
messages. It allows allows them to resize the field. Note the `errorMessage`
attributes of the `<aui:validator>` tags of the name and message fields. These
attributes specify messages that replace the default error message. You're
replacing the default error message (*This field is required*) field with custom
messages: *Please enter a name.* and *Please enter a message.*

Now click on *Add Entry* in the Guestbook portlet to view the form that you
updated. Notice that all the input fields are now marked as *Required*, thanks
to your `<aui:validator>` tags. 

Attempt to save a guestbook message with all of the fields left empty. Check
that the default error messages, along with your custom error message, are
displayed. Your Add Entry form should look like this: 

![Figure 1: Leave the Add Entry input fields empty and attempt to submit the form. It should look like this.](../../images/guestbook-form-validation.png)

Good! You've implemented form validation using AUI's validator tag. Next, you'll
learn how to limit the length of guestbook entry messages.

## Using the AUI Character Counter Module

AUI modules are small, powerful building blocks of UI functionality. Each module
provides a unique set of functionality that's designed to solve a particular
problem. In your case, you want to limit the number of characters that users can
enter into the message field of the Add Entry form. If you used the AUI
validator tag to limit the number of characters, users would have to know how
the character limit. They'd also have to remember how many characters they've
already entered. A much better solution is to use the AUI Character Counter
module. You can use this module not only to specify a limit on the number of
characters that can be entered, but also to display the number of remaining
characters.

Open the `edit_entry.jsp` file and add find the following section:

    <aui:input id="message" type="textarea" name="message">
        <aui:validator name="required" errorMessage="Please enter a message." />
    </aui:input>

Add the following line just below this section:

    <div id="counterContainer"><p><span id="counter"></span> character(s) remaining</p></div>

This `<div>` will display the number of remaining characters. To make it
work, we need to create an AUI script that uses the character counter to
populate the `<span id="counter"></span>` element.

Add the following code to the bottom the page:

    <aui:script use="aui-char-counter">
    AUI().use(
      function(A) {
        new A.CharCounter(
          {
            counter: '#counter',
            input: '#<portlet:namespace />message',
            maxLength: 140
          }
        );
      }
    );
    </aui:script>   

Here, you're specifying that the `<span id="counter"></span>` element should
be used for the counter, that the characters entered inside of the text area
created by the `<aui:input id="message" type="textarea" name="message">`
element should be counted, and that the maximum number of characters that
can be entered is `140`. Please refer to the
[AlloyUI Char Counter tutorial](http://alloyui.com/tutorials/char-counter)
tutorial for more information about the character counter module.

**Note:** Liferay IDE provides a *script* snippet that's available from the
Liferay AUI Taglib category of the Snippets tab. You can use this snippet
whenever you need to add an `<aui:script>` tag to a JSP page.

The following code loads the `aui-char-counter` module:

    AUI().use(
      'aui-char-counter',
      function(A) {

      }
    );

Adding the code below inside of the `function(A)` brackets creates an
instance of the character counter:

    new A.CharCounter(
      {
       
      }
    );

To configure this instance of the character counter module that you loaded,
you specify the following attributes in the character counter constructor:

    counter: '#counter',
    input: '#<portlet:namespace />message',
    maxLength: 140

This creates a fully functioning character counter. Specifying `counter:
'#counter'` configures the counter to display in the HTML element with the
`counter` ID. Specifying `input: '#<portlet:namespace />message'` selects
the input field (actually a text area in this case) whose characters are to
be counted. The `input` attribute is set to the message input element that
you created with the `message` ID. Since you're using an `<aui:input>` tag to
create the text area, the CSS ID of the text area is not actually `message`,
it's `_guestbook_WAR_guestbookportlet_message`. You don't have to remember the
prefix: just use the `<portlet:namespace />` tag to retrieve it.

Remember that when designing a portlet, you make to make sure that it will work
regardless of other portlets that may have been added to the page. There's no
guarantee that another portlet won't use CSS classnames or IDs that you assumed
would be unique. Using the prefix supplied by the `<portlet:namespace />` tag
ensures that there won't be naming conflicts with other elements on the page.
Finally, by specifying `maxLength: 140`, you limit the number of characters that
can be entered into the input field to `140`.

Now click on the Guestbook portlet's *Add Entry* button to test out the
guestbook entry form. Complete the form and check that your fancy new character
counter displays the number of remaining characters for your message. Your form
should look like the one below:
 
![Figure 2: With your new character counter, your form should look like this one.](../../images/guestbook-char-counter.png)

Excellent! Your front-end form validation is now complete! Next, you'll learn
how to manipulate the DOM with AlloyUI.
