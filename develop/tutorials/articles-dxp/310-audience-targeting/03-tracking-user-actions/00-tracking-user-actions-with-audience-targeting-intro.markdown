# Tracking User Actions with Audience Targeting [](id=tracking-user-actions-with-audience-targeting)

In Audience Targeting, a campaign defines a set of content targeted to specific 
user segments during a time period. Reports allow campaign administrators to 
learn how users behave in the context of a campaign by monitoring their 
interaction over different elements of the site. Out of the box, Liferay 
provides several metrics based on entity types that you can track, such as 
content, forms, links, pages, etc. For example, if you want track how many users
watch a YouTube video that is published on your site, you might create a custom
report with the YouTube Videos metric.

Audience Targeting ships with many metrics, but it's also extensible. This 
means that if the default metrics available do not fulfill your needs, you can 
create one yourself.

First you need to define some criteria about your metric:

- Entity to Track
- Tracking Mechanism
- Tracking Events
- Differentiation Method



Creating a metric involves targeting what you want to track in a report.
Suppose you're the owner of a hardware store you want to send emails to
your customers with the store's weekly newsletter. You send the
email every week, but you're in the dark about how many customers actually open
and read the newsletter. For this example, your entity to track is the 
newsletter.

To track how many customers view the newsletter, you must create a
tracking mechanism. You can provide a custom tracking mechanism (e.g., a
servlet) or you can use the ones provided by Audience Targeting. For a 
newsletter, you could use a transparent image as the tracking mechanism, which
would have the *View* tracking event capability. Whenever the image is viewed,
the Audience Targeting app computes and stores the information.

Finally, you must assign the metric to an entity. For a newsletter, you could
provide a Newsletter ID field that the user could fill in to differentiate
newsletters, if there's more than one.

section.

For this tutorial, you'll create a newsletter that can track who views it. To do this you will,

1.  Create a module with the necessary Content Targeting API dependencies.

2.  Define the metric's View/Save lifecycle.

3.  Implement a tracking mechanism and differentiation method.

4.  Define the UI.

Now that you have an idea of how to plan your new metric, you'll begin
creating one next!
