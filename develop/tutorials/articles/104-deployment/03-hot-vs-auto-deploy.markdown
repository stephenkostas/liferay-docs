# Hot Deploy Versus Auto Deploy [](id=deploying-your-plugins-hot-deploy-vs-auto-deploy)

As you develop plugins you'll want to deploy them to your test servers and as
you finish developing plugins you'll want to deploy them to your production
servers. There are *hot* deploy and *auto* deploy options to use in deploying
your plugins. Most people confuse the two concepts, believing them to be one and
the same. In reality, Liferay has TWO completely separate and different concepts
for them.

How, you say? We're glad you asked! This tutorial gives you a brief synopsis of 
each deployment method. Go ahead and get started by learning about the hot 
deployment method.

## Using Hot Deployment [](id=using-hot-deployment)

The first deployment method you'll explore is *hot* deployment. You may be
familiar with hot deployment in the context of Java EE application servers. In
summary, you place an application artifact (WAR or EAR) file into a specifically
configured directory, your application server (Tomcat, WebSphere, WebLogic,
etc.) picks up that artifact, deploys it within the application server, and
starts the application.

This model works really well for development purposes, since a server restart is
not required to view updates from your code changes. This model also works for
single node production deployments. 

However, this model completely breaks down when you deploy to a multi-node 
production deployment. In a multi-node environment, you have many more 
constraints to deal with, that require you to: 

- Ensure the application archive is available to all nodes
- Ensure the application deploys successfully across all nodes, simultaneously

Most application servers solve these constraints by using a master/slave type of
design: an admin server with multiple managed servers. When you hot deploy a
plugin, you use the admin server's user interface, or vendor console tool like
[Wsadmin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wsadmin), to add the archive, select
which managed servers should deploy it, and start the application. Application
server vendors often have different names and tools for these modes and tools:

- JBoss "domain" mode
- WebLogic "production" mode
- WebSphere deployment manager
- Tomcat FarmWarDeployer

These modes and tools reside completely outside of Liferay Portal and are
strictly in the application server's realm. However, Liferay piggybacks off the
application server's hot deploy capability and performs additional
initialization after a given application starts (e.g., via
`javax.servlet.ServletContextListener` mechanisms). 

<!-- "This is considered more as an application lifecycle and inter-application
dependency management as opposed to hot deploy. When Liferay moves fully to OSGi
in 7.0, we will more cleanly separtate "hot deploy" and "application lifecycle"
concepts."  We should keep these statements by Mike Han in mind for 7.0.-->

There are some specific Liferay capabilities that won't work unless your
application server has hot deployment capabilities. Specifically, hot deploying
custom JSPs in hooks won't work, because Liferay's JSP hook overriding
capabilities depend on the application server's ability to:

- Deploy based on an exploded portal WAR
- Load changes to JSP files at runtime

Application servers running in "production" and "domain" modes cannot support
these abilities, because in these deployment models, most servers don't use
exploded WARs. As such, these application servers don't support JSP
reloading/recompilation in these modes. Even for Tomcat, it's generally
advisable to deactivate JSP reloading for production deployments. 

So what do you do if you use hooks to override Liferay JSPs AND you must use
non-exploded WAR deployments? The answer is simple: inject a pre-processing
stage as part of your build process. You deploy the hooks, allowing them to make
changes to the portal WAR file. Then you rebundle the portal WAR file and deploy
it using the application server's deployment tools. Of course, you still need to
deploy your hook as well, but you no longer need to worry about the JSP
overrides not being loaded by your application server.

Hopefully this whets your appetite for doing hot deployments. Stay hungry, as
it's time to explore auto deployment next. 

## Using Auto Deployment [](id=using-auto-deployment)

The Liferay *auto* deployment feature is a mostly optional feature that works in
conjunction with the hot deployment capabilities of your application server.
Where Liferay's hot deploy leverages the hot deploy capabilities of your app
server and performs additional initializations, auto deploy injects the required 
JAR files and descriptors into your application's archive file. Executing 
`ant deploy` invokes both hot deployment and auto deployment tasks for your 
plugin. 

So how does auto deployment work with Liferay plugins? Auto deployment completes
the following tasks:

1. Picks up a Liferay recognized archive (e.g., `*-portlet.*`, `*-theme.*`,
   `*-web.*`, `*.lpkg`)
2. Injects required libraries (e.g., `util-java.jar`, `util-taglib.jar`)
3. Injects dependent JAR files (specified in `liferay-plugins.properties`)
4. Injects required taglib descriptors (e.g., `liferay-theme.tld`)
5. Injects required deployment descriptors (e.g., app server specific
   descriptors)
6. Injects any missing Liferay specific deployment descriptors (e.g.,
   `liferay-portlet.xml`)

By relying on auto deployment to complete these tasks automatically, you save
time and you don't even have to learn all of Liferay's deployment descriptors.
However, this feature is incompatible with application server farms and
multi-node modes. 

So now you're probably wondering how to configure your application server in
these situations? The answer is simple: Do not use the auto deployment method at
runtime; use it at build time.

The Liferay Plugins SDK allows you to preprocess your archives and inject all
the required elements. You therefore bypass the auto deployer at runtime. You 
simply need to call the following Ant task:

    ant direct-deploy

The `direct-deploy` Ant task creates an exploded WAR from which you can easily
create a WAR file. The location of the exploded WAR depends on the deployment
directory of the application server you've configured in your Plugins SDK
environment. See the
[Developing with the Plugins SDK](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/plugins-sdk)
tutorials for instructions on configuring the Plugins SDK for your app server.
The Plugins SDK's `build.properties` provides a default deployment directory
value for each supported app server. But you can override the default value by
specifying your desired value for the `app.server.[type].deploy.dir` (replace
`[type]` with your app server type) in your `build.[username].properties` file. 

If you choose not to use the Liferay Plugins SDK to do direct deployment, you
can examine the `build-common.xml` file in the Plugins SDK to see how Liferay
invokes the deployer tools.

Terrific! You now know the differences between hot deploy and auto deploy.
Understanding what's going on during the deployment of your plugins is crucial
for troubleshooting anything that goes wrong, and can help you simplify your
deployment process and make it more efficient.
