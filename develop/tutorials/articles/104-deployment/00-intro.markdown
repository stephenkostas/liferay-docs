# Deploying Plugins [](id=deploying-plugins)

In order for a plugin to affect the portal it must be deployed to it. As you
develop plugins you'll want to test them on a portal. Commonly, developers test
their plugins on a portal instance on their machine. Deploying to a local
instance is non-restrictive and easy to do. Eventually, however, you'll need to
deploy your plugins to remote test servers and, finally, to production servers.
No matter what stage of development you're in, it's important for you and your
portal administrators to know the plugin deployment options available. This
section of tutorials explains the deployment options and how they work.
