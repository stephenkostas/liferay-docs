# Developing Your First Portlet [](id=developing-your-first-portlet)

So far, you've installed and set up @ide@, created a Liferay Workspace, 
generated a project, and deployed it to a running bundle. Next you'll add
functionality and start fully developing your Liferay Web Application. Here's
what you'll do: 

- Create functional buttons for adding and removing guestbook entries
- Create a form for users to create and edit guestbook entries
- Create an interface for displaying guestbook entries
- Implement a prototype storage system (to be replaced later) for storing
    guestbook entries

At the end, you'll have a fully functional prototype application ready to be
enhanced later! There's no time like now to get started.
