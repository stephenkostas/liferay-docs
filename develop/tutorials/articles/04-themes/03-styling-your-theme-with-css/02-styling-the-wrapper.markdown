# Styling the Wrapper [](id=styling-the-wrapper)

The Wrapper is the container that holds the theme's elements. It is used for
positioning and styling the theme as a whole. You'll use the Wrapper to create
the dimensions and background for the theme.
 
1.  Add the following code below the *Wrapper* placeholder:

        #wrapper {
            background-color: $bkColor;
            margin: 0 auto;
            max-width: 1000px;
            padding:0;
            position:relative;
 
2.  Since the Banner, Content, and Footer sections all go inside the Wrapper,
    add the closing `}` (brace) for the `#wrapper` just above the closing `}` at the
    bottom of the file. 
   
    The CSS above makes use of the SASS `$bkColor` variable to color the
    background of the wrapper, separating it from the background gradient. Most 
    important, it sets the width and margins for the theme.     
    
    As a design choice, the wrapper has been given a set width, `max-width:
    1000px;` , and centered,`margin: 0 auto;`, relative to the browser. This
    allows the gradient background to show when the browser is wider than the
    `max-width`. If users view the theme in a larger display than the
    `max-width`, they won't be greeted with dead pixels on either side of the
    main content. You always want to keep the user experience in mind when
    designing the theme.
    
    Using the `max-width` property sets the width, while also allowing it to be 
    flexible. In a later section of the Learning Path, this will let the theme 
    scale down for smaller devices. Had the `width` property been used instead,
    the width would be carved in stone.
 
3.  Save the file and navigate to the *Welcome* page and refresh it to see the 
    changes.
    
    Your theme should look like the following figure:

    Now that the Wrapper for the content is styled, you can move on to the
    Banner next.
