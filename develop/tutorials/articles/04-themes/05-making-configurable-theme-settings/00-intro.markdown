# Making Configurable Theme Settings [](id=making-configurable-theme-settings)

Theme settings allow you to give Administrators control over the elements of 
the page without having to touch any of the code directly.

Theme settings can then be modified on a site-wide or a page by page basis. With
a few simple clicks of the mouse, an Admin can remove and add theme elements
you've created settings for.

Now that you know what theme settings can provide, you can learn how to
configure them next.
