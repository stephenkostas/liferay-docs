# Developing a Liferay Theme [](id=developing-a-liferay-theme)

As a developer, you want your site to communicate your ideas clearly and 
effectively. You don't want the design of your site to inhibit users from
interacting with your content. This is where themes come into play. Themes allow
you to take creative control and tell the story you want to tell with your site.
They give you control over the look and feel of your site, down to the tiniest
detail.

As you approach the theme's design, keep in mind the target audience, the 
message you are trying to communicate, and the site's purpose. The theme's 
design helps answer these questions.

This Learning Path takes you through developing a theme for Liferay's Lunar
Resort using the Freemarker template language. You'll learn how to style your 
theme with CSS, how to make it responsive for mobile devices, how to leverage 
Bootstrap's and Font Awesome's icons in your theme, and how to implement
configurable theme settings.

Before you start, make sure you have a Liferay development environment installed. 
You can learn how to install Liferay IDE or Liferay Developer Studio in the 
[Beginning Liferay Development](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/beginning-liferay-development)
Learning Path. You can use other tools for development, but Liferay's
development tools are the most natural to use, since they're designed for
Liferay. Because you'll be deploying a lot of changes throughout this
Learning Path, make sure you also have developer mode enabled in your Portal.
You can learn how to enable developer mode for your Portal in
the [Using Developer Mode with Themes](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/using-developer-mode-with-themes)
tutorial.

It's time to get started!
