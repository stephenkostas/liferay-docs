# Previewing Your Theme [](id=previewing-your-theme)

To determine what changes need to be made, you can use Liferay's preview window 
to see how the theme responds with the existing CSS styles. Locate the Dockbar 
icons on the left side of the screen. Underneath the plus icon, you'll see a 
screen icon: this is the *Preview button*.

Click the *Preview button* to bring up the *Preview window*. Make sure you have
the page scrolled all the way to the top before clicking the Preview button.
Failing to do so may result in the Preview window being out of view.

Inside the Preview menu, you can see four pre-defined render options, as well as
a Custom ratio size option. By default you see your site in the *Smartphone*
preview. A good rule of thumb is to work organically, starting with the desktop
view you're used to and previewing your theme on smaller and smaller devices. By
the end of this section you'll understand why this is true. For the moment,
just keep it in mind. 

1.  Select the *Tablet* preview.

    Each device displays the site in portrait view by default. If you click on 
    the *Tablet* preview a second time, you'll see that your site is now 
    rendered in landscape view. Clicking the current preview a third time 
    returns your view back to portrait. 

2.  Scroll through the theme in the Preview window and you'll see the elements 
    that must be modified. 

    First of all, the carousel is outside the borders of the page, so it should 
    be removed in tablet view. Second, While the navigation is functional, it's 
    not very tablet friendly, so you need to change it. Finally, while the logo 
    looks okay, it could be scaled down some.

    As a best practice, you should also see how the theme responds in landscape 
    view. 

3.  Switch to landscape view to verify that the same elements need modification 
    for the tablet.

    Now that the theme has been tested on the tablet, you can see how it 
    responds to a phone next.

4.  Select the *Smartphone* preview to view it.

5.  Scroll through the site in the Preview window to see how it responds on a 
    phone.

Now in the *Smartphone* preview, you can see that the same concerning areas on a
tablet are more obvious in this preview: the logo is too large and needs to be
scaled down; the navigation is even more squeezed than before; the carousel is
even further beyond the borders of the page and definitely needs to be removed
in this view.

Everything else seems to be responding well. Switching to landscape view 
confirms the same.

Now that you have identified the elements needing modification for
responsiveness, you can move on to the next section.
