# Setting up the Theme [](id=setting-up-the-theme)

In this portion of the Learning Path, you'll create the foundation for the Lunar
Resort theme. You'll learn the proper workflow and directory structure needed to
create a theme. Finally, you'll modify the default `portal/_normal.ftl` and
`navigation.ftl` templates to match the Lunar Resort mock up.

A theme mock up serves as a guide for what the finished theme will look like:

To get started, 
[download the resources](/documents/10184/532726/themes-learning-path-6.2.zip) 
you'll need to go through each exercise and unzip them to a folder of your 
choice. 

Now you can go ahead and jump right into creating the theme project!
