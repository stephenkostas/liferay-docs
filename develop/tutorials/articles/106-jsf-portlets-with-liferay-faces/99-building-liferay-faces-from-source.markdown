# Building Liferay Faces From Source [](id=building-liferay-faces-from-source)

You may have several reasons for downloading and building Liferay Faces from its
project source code: 

- To try out the latest cutting edge changes
- To investigate a suspected bug
- To learn how Liferay Faces is implemented

For this tutorial, you'l learn how to access the Liferay Faces source code and
build it yourself. 

First, you'll start with installing the liferay-faces project. 

## Installing the liferay-faces Project [](id=installing-the-liferay-faces-project)

It's important to install the version of Liferay Faces that you want. So, it's a
good idea to check the [Liferay Faces Version
Scheme](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/understanding-the-liferay-faces-version-scheme)
to confirm the version of Liferay Faces.

You can either install the project by cloning it from GitHub or by downloading
it as a `.zip` file. Both options are demonstrated below. 

**Cloning the project from GitHub**

Cloning the project requires that you [set up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) 
on your machine. Once you've set up Git, you can download the liferay-faces
project from GitHub and work with a particular branch of the project, following
these instructions: 

1. Execute the following command from your terminal:

        git clone https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces.git

2. Navigate into that directory by executing `cd liferay-faces`.

3. Checkout the branch (`master` is the default branch) you want to use.

    For example, to use the first milestone release of version 4.2.0, execute
    the following command:

        git checkout 4.2.0-m1

**Downloading the project as a `.zip` file**

To download the liferay-faces project as a `.zip` file, follow these
instructions: 

1. Visit the Liferay Faces project page:
   [https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces). 

2. Click on the *branch* drop-down menu and select the branch or tag for the
   version of the liferay-faces project that you'd like to use. 

3. Click on the *Download Zip* button on that right side of the page to download
   the `[branch/tag name].zip` file for that branch or tag. 

4.  Extract the `.zip` file contents to a location on your machine.

5. In a terminal window, navigate into the liferay-faces project's root
   directory: 

        cd liferay-faces-[version]

Now that you've installed the liferay-faces project, you can configure your
environment for building the project. In the next section of this tutorial,
you'll explore building Liferay Faces with Maven. 

## Building Liferay Faces with Maven [](id=building-liferay-faces-with-maven)

Maven is required to build the liferay-faces project. You can download Maven
from
[http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). It
is recommended to place your Maven installation's `bin` directory in your
system's `$PATH`, so you can run the Maven executable (`mvn`) easily from your
terminal. 

1. Copy the `externalLiferayFacesRepositories` `<profile>` from
   [`settings.xml`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/settings.xml)
   into your local `$HOME/.m2/settings.xml` file. If you do not already have a
   `settings.xml` file in your Maven configuration, create a `settings.xml`
   file in your `$HOME/.m2` folder and copy the contents of the
   [`settings.xml`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/settings.xml)
   file into it. 

2. Make sure you're in the liferay-faces directory and, then, build the source with Maven by executing the following command: 

        mvn clean package

Maven builds the following Liferay Faces artifacts: 

- `alloy/target/liferay-faces-alloy-[version].jar`
- `bridge-api/target/liferay-faces-bridge-api-[version].jar`
- `bridge-impl/target/liferay-faces-bridge-impl-[version].jar`
- `portal/target/liferay-faces-portal-[version].jar`
- `util/target/liferay-faces-util-[version].jar`

That's it; you've built Liferay Faces from source!
