# Internationalization [](id=internationalization)

@product@ makes it easier than ever to localize content and design apps for
different locales. You can centralize messages (language keys) and have manual
and automatic translation, including localizing forms and setting text
directionality from left-to-right or right-to-left. Customizing messages in apps
is easy too. Internationalization is a snap with @product@!
