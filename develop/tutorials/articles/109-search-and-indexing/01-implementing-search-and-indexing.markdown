# Implementing Search and Indexing [](id=implementing-search-and-indexing)

Liferay's search and indexing functionality is provided by Apache Lucene, a
Java-based search library. To implement search and indexing functionality for an
entity, you need to follow these three steps:

1. Create an `*Indexer` class in your portlet project and register this class in
   your project's `liferay-portlet.xml` file.

2. Update your entity's service layer so that the index is updated upon the
   creation, modification, or deletion of an entity.

3. Provide a mechanism to perform a search. For example, you could create one
   JSP in your portlet project for entering search queries and another JSP for
   displaying the search results. Or you could simply configure Liferay's Search
   portlet to search for your entities.

You'll explore each of these steps in the following sections. Before proceeding,
make sure you're familiar with the following search and indexing terminology.

- A search index contains a collection of *documents*. These documents are not
  documents in the ordinary English sense of the word. Rather, they are Java
  objects that represent entities that have been saved to the database.

- A document contains a collection of *fields* and their values. A document's
  fields represent the metadata about each document. Some typical fields are
  *title*, *content*, *description*, *create date*, *modified date*, *tags*,
  etc. A document's fields do not necessarily have to correspond to the
  associated entity's attributes.

- A field can be *single-valued* or *multi-valued*. A single-valued field
  can have only one term. A multi-valued field can have multiple terms. A *term*
  is a single, non-whitespaced value that can be searched. 

- A *phrase* is a series of terms separated by spaces. The only way to use a
  phrase as a term in a search is to surround it with double quotes ("). 

- The result of a search is a collection of *hits*. Hits are pointers to
  documents that match the search query.

## Creating and Registering an Indexer Class [](id=creating-and-registering-an-indexer-class)

Indexer classes are responsible for creating the Lucene documents that represent
your entities. When creating an indexer class, you need to decide which
fields your documents should contain and how they should be populated. It's
recommended that your indexer class extend
`com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.BaseIndexer` or at least implement
`com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.Indexer`. This makes it possible to aggregate
your entities with portal entities (assets) and allows your entities to use
existing portal frameworks such as faceted search. If you want to asset-enable
your entities, creating an indexer for them is a necessary step. When
creating an indexer class, you can use the indexer classes that correspond to
Liferay assets as examples. These include `BlogsIndexer`,
`JournalArticleIndexer`, `WikiPageIndexer`, etc. You can refer to the [Search and Indexing](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/enabling-search-and-indexing)
learning path for another example.

If your indexer class extends `com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.BaseIndexer` (as
recommended), you need to override or provide implementations for the following
methods:

- `public String[] getClassNames()`
- `public String getPortletId()`
- `protected void doDelete(Object obj)`
- `protected Document doGetDocument(Object obj)`
- `protected Summary doGetSummary(Document document, Locale locale,
        String snippet, PortletURL portletURL)`
- `protected void doReindex(Object obj)`
- `protected void doReindex(String className, long classPK) `
- `protected void doReindex(String[] ids)`
- `protected String getPortletId(SearchContext searchContext)`

It's also recommended to define a `public static final String[] CLASS_NAMES`
constant and a `public static final String PORTLET_ID` constant. These constants
should contain the names of the entity classes and the name of the associated
portlet. Liferay's `*Indexer` classes follow this convention. Using these
constants in your plugin ensures that you are consistently using the correct
class names and portlet ID throughout your indexing code. The 
[search and indexing learning path](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/enabling-search-and-indexing) 
referenced above explains how to implement the required methods. Liferay's 
`*Indexer` classes also provide good examples.

Once you've written an indexer class for your entity, you need to register this
class with Liferay. To do so, open your portlet project's
`docroot/WEB-INF/liferay-portlet.xml` file and add an entry like this:

    <indexer-class>[fully qualified class name of the indexer class]</indexer-class>

E.g.,

    <indexer-class>com.liferay.portlet.blogs.util.BlogsIndexer</indexer-class>

If you're working in a newly generated `liferay-portlet.xml` file, the entry
should be added just below the `<icon>` element inside of the `<portlet>`
element that corresponds to the portlet to which you're adding the indexer. If
you're working in a `liferay-portlet.xml` file with lots of entries, please
refer to the [DTD](http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-portlet-app_6_2_0.dtd) to
figure out where the indexer class entry should be added. Re-deploy your project
after you've added the `<indexer-class>` element to `liferay-portlet.xml` so
that Liferay registers your indexer with your portlet.

If you'd like to review the contents of your portal's indexer registry, you can
execute the following Groovy script from Liferay's Script console. This script
uses Liferay's `IndexerRegistryUtil` class to retrieve a list of registered
indexers.  Then it prints the associated portlet ID and classnames for each
indexer. To access the Script console, go to *Admin* &rarr; *Control Panel*,
then click on *Server Administration*, then *Script*. Select *Groovy* for the
language, and then enter the following script.

+$$$

**Caution:** Before executing any script on a production Liferay instance, make
sure to test it locally first.

$$$

Review the script, then click *Execute*.

    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.IndexerRegistryUtil;
    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.Indexer;

    import java.util.List;

    List<Indexer> indexers = IndexerRegistryUtil.getIndexers();

    for (Indexer indexer : indexers) {
        System.out.println("portletId: " + indexer.getPortletId());

        String[] classnames = indexer.getClassNames();

        for (String classname : classnames) {
            System.out.println("classname: " + classname);
        }

        System.out.println();
    }

Check your console to find a list of portlet IDs and their associated indexer
class names. Check that your portlet and the indexer class that you registered
in `liferay-portlet.xml` appear in the list.

## Implementing Indexing at the Service Layer [](id=implementing-indexing-at-the-service-layer)

If you're creating a data-driven application, you've presumably written code for
adding, updating, and deleting your entities. If you want the documents
corresponding to your entities in Liferay's Lucene index to accurately reflect
the entities themselves, you need to make sure that you're instructing
your indexer to reindex any added or updated entities. When an entity is
deleted, you need to remove the corresponding document from the index. To obtain
an instance of your indexer class, use Liferay's `IndexerRegistryUtil` class.
This class includes a `getIndexer` method as well as a `nullSafeGetIndexer`
method. Both of these methods can take either a class argument (e.g.
`MyEntity.class`) or a string representing the class name (e.g.  `MyEntity`). If
you use `getIndexer` and no indexer in the registry matches the argument, `null`
is returned. However, if you use `nullSafeGetIndexer` and no indexer matches the
argument, a dummy indexer is returned. Returning a dummy indexer is safer than
returning `null` since returning `null` might throw exceptions that could render
your portlet unusable.

Once you've obtained the indexer that corresponds to your entity, you need to
invoke the appropriate indexing operation. Whenever a new entity is added, a
corresponding document should be added to the index. Whenever an existing entity
is updated, the corresponding document should be updated. Both of these tasks,
indexing and reindexing, can be accomplished by invoking the `reindex` method of
your indexer. This method is overloaded. You can provide the object to be
indexed as an argument, or you can provide the entity's class name and primary
key. When an entity is deleted, its corresponding document should be removed
from the index. You can do this by invoking your indexer's `delete` method.
Like `reindex`, `delete` is overloaded, and can take an object or the entity's
class name and primary key as arguments.

If you're using Service Builder for your portlet project's service layer, you
know that custom business logic should be added to your entity's
`[Entity]LocalServiceImpl` class. If you've integrated your application with
Liferay's permissions system, you probably have `add[Entity]`, `update[Entity]`,
and `delete[Entity]` methods which invoke various methods of
`resourceLocalService` to add, update, and delete entity resources. If you've
asset-enabled your entity, you've used `assetEntryLocalService` and
`assetLinkLocalService` to add, update, and delete your entity's asset entries
and asset links (related assets). You'll use a similar procedure to add and
remove entities from the index. To do this, add the following lines inside 
your `add[Entity]` and `update{Entity]` methods:

    Indexer indexer = IndexerRegistryUtil.nullSafeGetIndexer([Entity].class);

    indexer.reindex(entry);

And add the following lines inside your `delete[Entity]` method:

    Indexer indexer = IndexerRegistryUtil.nullSafeGetIndexer([Entity].class);

    indexer.delete(entry);

Of course, in both of the above snippets, replace `[Entity]` with the name of
your entity. Save your `[Entity]LocalServiceImpl.java` file and redeploy your
portlet project.

Use your portlet to add and update some entities to test your indexer. If
it's working correctly, your indexer should add documents to Liferay's index for
each entity that's added or updated. By default, Liferay's index data is stored
in the `[Liferay Home]/data/lucene` folder. This folder contains sub-folders
corresponding to each of your portal instances. For instance, if your default
portal instance has a company ID of `10154`, there should be a folder called
`10154` in your `[Liferay Home]/data/lucene`. The contents of the `10154` folder
are in binary format; they're not human-readable. However, you can use a
third-party tool, such as Luke, to browse the Lucene indexes.

Luke is a development tool which allows you to browse and modify existing Lucene
indexes. It is provided as free and open-source software. You can obtain it from
Google Code here:
[https://code.google.com/p/luke](https://code.google.com/p/luke). Download the
`.jar` file. To start Luke, open a command line or terminal, navigate to the
directory which contains the `.jar` file, and run the following command:

    java -jar lukeall-3.5.0.jar

If you have a newer version of Luke, replace the version above with your
version. Once Luke is running, you want to check Liferay's Lucene indexes to
make sure that your entities have been indexed. Click *File* &rarr; *Open
Lucene Index* and enter the path to the folder of the portal instance whose
index you want to open. E.g., if your portal instance's company is `10154`,
enter the following path:

    [Liferay Home]/data/lucene/10154

Check the following boxes to make sure that you can open the indexes and that
you won't accidentally modify the indexes as you're browsing:

- Open in Read-Only mode
- Force unlock, if locked

Then click *OK*. If you click on Luke's Documents tab, you can browse all the
indexed documents by document number. If you click on Luke's Search tab, you can
enter a search query. Click on *Search*, and Luke displays a list of all
matching documents. Use Luke to check that the entities you added via
your portlet appear in Liferay's Lucene index. If you need to learn Lucene's
search query syntax, please refer to Lucene's
[documentation](http://lucene.apache.org/core/3_5_0/queryparsersyntax.html).
Note: Liferay 6.2 uses Lucene 3.5.0.

## Providing a Search Mechanism [](id=providing-a-search-mechanism)

Now that your indexer has been registered and the index is updated whenever an
entity is added, updated, or deleted, it's time to create a search mechanism.
The easiest way to allow users to search for your entities is via
Liferay's Search portlet. By default, Liferay's Search portlet only allows
searching for out-of-the-box Liferay assets:

- Users
- Bookmarks
- Bookmark folders
- Blog posts
- Documents and Media files
- Documents and Media folders
- Web Content files
- Web Content folders
- Message Board Messages
- Wiki pages

It's easy to configure the Search portlet to search for additional asset types.
To do so, add the Search portlet to a page and open the Configuration window. On
the Setup tab, click on *Advanced* to reveal the Search Configuration text area.
Search through the JSON configuration for the following block of code:

    "values": [
        "com.liferay.portal.model.User",
        "com.liferay.portlet.bookmarks.model.BookmarksEntry",
        "com.liferay.portlet.bookmarks.model.BookmarksFolder",
        "com.liferay.portlet.blogs.model.BlogsEntry",
        "com.liferay.portlet.documentlibrary.model.DLFileEntry",
        "com.liferay.portlet.documentlibrary.model.DLFolder",
        "com.liferay.portlet.journal.model.JournalArticle",
        "com.liferay.portlet.journal.model.JournalFolder",
        "com.liferay.portlet.messageboards.model.MBMessage",
        "com.liferay.portlet.wiki.model.WikiPage"
    ],

Append your entity to this list so that it looks like this:

    "values": [
        "com.liferay.portal.model.User",
        "com.liferay.portlet.bookmarks.model.BookmarksEntry",
        "com.liferay.portlet.bookmarks.model.BookmarksFolder",
        "com.liferay.portlet.blogs.model.BlogsEntry",
        "com.liferay.portlet.documentlibrary.model.DLFileEntry",
        "com.liferay.portlet.documentlibrary.model.DLFolder",
        "com.liferay.portlet.journal.model.JournalArticle",
        "com.liferay.portlet.journal.model.JournalFolder",
        "com.liferay.portlet.messageboards.model.MBMessage",
        "com.liferay.portlet.wiki.model.WikiPage",
        "your.package.path.YourEntity"
    ],

Of course, replace the package path and entity name with your
package path and entity name. Then click *Save*. You can add any number of
entities to the Search portlet's configuration this way. For more
information on the JSON configuration of the Search portlet, please refer to the
Search portlet's documentation:
[Searching for Content in Liferay](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/searching-for-content-in-liferay).

However, you don't have to use Liferay's Search portlet. In this section, you'll
learn how to use Liferay's API to create a search mechanism in your own
portlet. You can create one JSP for entering a search query and another JSP for
displaying the search results. When implementing search and indexing in a 
portlet, the following Liferay classes are important:

- `com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.SearchContext`
- `com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.SearchContextFactory`
- `com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.Indexer`
- `com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.IndexerRegistryUtil`
- `com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.BaseIndexer`
- `com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.SearchEngineUtil`
- `com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.Hits`
- `com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.Document`

To execute a search query in Liferay, you need a `SearchContext` object. The
search context provides such details as the company instance to search, the user
invoking the search, the locale, the timezone, etc. Since this class has a wide
variety of context properties to deal with, the most effective way to get an
instance of it is to call the `getInstance(HttpServletRequest request)` method
of `SearchContextFactory` like this:

    SearchContext searchContext = SearchContextFactory.getInstance(request);

Once you have a `SearchContext` object, you can populate various values such as
the keywords to search for, the pagination type, the start and end values, etc.
For example, you could use these values:

    searchContext.setKeywords(keywords);
    searchContext.setAttribute("paginationType", "more");
    searchContext.setStart(0);
    searchContext.setEnd(10);

The keywords value is the most important search context attribute since it
represents the term or phrase for which you're searching. To find additional
`SearchContext` attributes, please refer to the
[Javadocs](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs).

Earlier, you saw how to use `IndexerRegistryUtil` to obtain an instance of your
indexer. You can use any of the following four methods:

- `getIndexer(Class<?> clazz)`
- `getIndexer(String className)`
- `nullSafeGetIndexer(Class<?> clazz)`
- `nullSafeGetIndexer(String className)`

Remember that when you deployed your plugin project, Liferay registered your
indexer. When you invoke one of the above methods, Liferay returns an instance
of the indexer class that corresponds to the class or class name argument that
you supplied. Also, remember that your indexer class should extend
`com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.BaseIndexer` or at least implement
`com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.Indexer`. The `Indexer` interface defines a
`search(SearchContext searchContext)` method that returns a `Hits` object. The
`BaseIndexer` abstract class provides an implementation of this method that
invokes `SearchEngineUtil.search`.

While it's possible to use a specific indexer to perform a search, it's also
possible to perform a search using `SearchEngineUtil.search` directly.
`SearchEngineUtil` handles all the intricacies of the search engine
implementation. All traffic to and from the search engine implementation passes
through this class. If you're debugging a problem with your application's search
and indexing functionality, it can be beneficial to enable debug level logging
on this class.

The result of invoking either an indexer's `search(SearchContext searchContext)`
method or of invoking `SearchEngineUtil.search` directly is a `Hits`
object. A `Hits` object contains the Lucene documents that match the search
query. The Lucene documents, which are `Document` objects, can be retrieved from
the `Hits` object in either array or list form. For example, suppose you have an
indexer for an entity called `MyEntity`. Suppose further that you have a search
context object called `searchContext` that contains the `keywords` string
containing that phrase for which you want to search. You could invoke a search
to obtain a `Hits` object like this:

    Indexer indexer = IndexerRegistryUtil.getIndexer("MyEntity");

    try {
        Hits hits = indexer.search(searchContext);
    }
    catch (SearchException se) {
        // handle search exception
    }

If you want to use `SearchEngineUtil.search` directly (instead of using an
indexer to search), you need to create your own search query and make sure that
your search context is configured appropriately. Indexers in Liferay are
associated with specific entities. When you use an indexer to search, only the
specified entities are searched. You can bypass this by using
`SearchEngineUtil.search`, which lets you specify the entities you want to
search for by invoking the `searchContext.setEntryClassNames`
method of your search context. You should also specify the scope of the search
by invoking the `searchContext.setCompanyId` and `searchContext.setGroupIds`
methods of your search context.

`SearchEngineUtil.search` is an overloaded method. The easiest form of
this method to use is `SearchEngineUtil.search(SearchContext searchContext,
Query query)`. To use this method, you need to construct your own query. Liferay
provides the base `Query` interface as well as several others which extend it,
including these:

- `BooleanQuery`
- `TermRangeQuery`
- `TermQuery`

Liferay also provides several query implementations and factory classes. Use
Liferay's query factory classes to instantiate query implementation classes. For
example, suppose you want to use Liferay's search engine to search for indexed
documents containing the term *liferay* in the *title* field. To do so, you
could use the following code:

    TermQuery termQuery = TermQueryFactoryUtil.create(searchContext, "title", "liferay");

    try {
        Hits hits = SearchEngineUtil.search(searchContext, termQuery);
    }
    catch (SearchException se) {
        // handle search exception
    }

If you want to search for indexed documents with field values within a certain
range, you can use term range queries. For example, suppose you wanted to
construct a query that searches for indexed documents that were modified on a
certain day, such as December 4, 2014. To construct such a query, you could use
the following code:

    TermRangeQuery termRangeQuery = TermRangeQueryFactoryUtil.create(searchContext, "modified", "201412040000000", "201412050000000", true, true);

    try {
        Hits hits = SearchEngineUtil.search(searchContext, termRangeQuery);
    }
    catch (SearchException se) {
        // handle search exception
    }

To programmatically construct more complex queries, you can use boolean queries.
For example, suppose you wanted construct a query that searches for indexed
documents containing the term *liferay* in the *title* field but not *lucene* in
the *description* field and that were modified on December 4, 2014. To construct
such a query, you could use the following code:

    TermQuery termQuery1 = TermQueryFactoryUtil.create(searchContext, "title", "liferay");
    TermQuery termQuery2 = TermQueryFactoryUtil.create(searchContext, "description", "lucene");
    TermRangeQuery termRangeQuery = TermRangeQueryFactoryUtil.create(searchContext, "modified", "201412040000000", "201412050000000", true, false);

    BooleanQuery booleanQuery = BooleanQueryFactoryUtil.create(searchContext);

    booleanQuery.add(termQuery1, BooleanClauseOccur.MUST);
    booleanQuery.add(termQuery2, BooleanClauseOccur.MUST_NOT);
    booleanQuery.add(termRangeQuery, BooleanClauseOccur.MUST);

    try {
        Hits hits = SearchEngineUtil.search(searchContext, booleanQuery);
    }
    catch (SearchException se) {
        // handle search exception
    }

In addition to `BooleanQuery`, `TermRangeQuery`, and `TermQuery`, Liferay
provides a `StringQuery` implementation class. This query implementation allows
you to construct queries using Lucene's query syntax. Please refer to the
[Faceted Search and Customized Search Filtering](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/faceted-search-and-customized-search-filtering)
tutorial for an example that uses a `StringQuery`. Once you've performed a
search and have obtained a `Hits` object, you can retrieve the corresponding
documents in array form like this:

    Document[] docs = hits.getDocs();

Or you can retrieve the documents in list form:

    List<Document> docs = hits.toList();

To display the search results, you have to iterate over the array or list of
documents. Each document is essentially a hash map of the indexed fields and
their values. Please refer to the
[Search and Indexing Learning Path](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/enabling-search-and-indexing)
for an explanation of how to create a portlet user interface that facilitates
searching and viewing search results. In that Learning Path's example, a search
bar is added to the JSP that renders the main portlet view. When a search query
is submitted, the phrase entered by the user is submitted as a `keywords` string
to the JSP that renders the search results. The JSP that renders the search
results contains the code that creates and populates a search context, obtains
an `Indexer`, uses the `Indexer` to search, and retrieves the entities that
correspond to the `Hits` resulting from the search. However, this code does not
have to live in the JSP. You could pull all of this logic out of the JSP and
into a portlet action method or into a portlet service method that's invoked by
a portlet action method.

In this tutorial, you've learned how to create and register an indexer for an
entity in your portlet project. You've learned how to update your service
layer so that your indexer is invoked whenever an add, update, or delete
operation is performed on an entity. You've also seen how to use Liferay's
search API to configure a search context, perform a search, and obtain a list of
search results. To explore more features of Liferay's search API, please see the
tutorial on Faceted Search and Customized Search Filtering.
