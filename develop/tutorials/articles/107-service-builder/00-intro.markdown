# Service Builder and Services [](id=service-builder)

For an introduction to Liferay's Service Builder tool, please refer to the
[Writing a Data-Driven Application](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/writing-a-data-driven-application)
learning path. This learning path demonstrates how to create easy-to-maintain
data-driven applications that use Service Builder to generate locally accessible
services. Locally accessible services can be invoked by other Liferay
applications running on the same Liferay instance as your application. To learn
how to use Service Builder to generate remotely accessible services for your
application, please refer to the
[Creating Web Services for Your Application](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/creating-web-services-for-your-application)
learning path. Remotely accessible services can be invoked from any application
that can access your Liferay instance (e.g., over the internet) and has
permission to do so. If, for example, you want mobile application developers to
be able to create clients that can interact with your application, you should
generate remote services for your application. This section's tutorials build on
the basics covered in the learning paths. They provide more details on Service
Builder's features, the code it generates, and Liferay services.
