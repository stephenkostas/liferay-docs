# Configuring service.properties [](id=configuring-service-properties)

Service Builder generates a `service.properties` file in your project's
`docroot/WEB-INF/src` folder. Liferay Portal uses the properties in this file to
alter your service's database schema and load Spring configuration files to
support deployment of your service. You should not modify this file, but rather
make any necessary overrides in a `service-ext.properties` file in that same
folder.

Here are some of the properties included in the `service.properties` file:

- `build.auto.upgrade`: This is `true` by default. This property determines
  whether or not Liferay should automatically apply changes to the database
  model when a new version of the plugin is deployed.
- `build.namespace`: This is the namespace you defined in
  `docroot/WEB-INF/service.xml`. Liferay distinguishes different plugins from
  each other using their namespaces.
- `build.number`: Liferay distinguishes different builds of your plugin. Each
  time a distinct build of your plugin is deployed to Liferay, Liferay
  increments this number.
- `build.date`: This is the time of the latest build of your plugin.
- `spring.configs`: This is a comma-delimited list of Spring configurations.
- `include-and-override`: The default value of this property defines
  `service-ext.properties` as an override file for `service.properties`.

It's sometimes useful to override the `build.auto.upgrade` property from
`service.properties`. Setting `build.auto.upgrade=false` in your
`service-ext.properties` file prevents Liferay from trying automatically to
apply any changes to the database model when a new version of the plugin is
deployed. This is needed in projects in which it is preferred to manually manage
the changes to the database or in which the SQL schema has intentionally been
modified manually after generation by Service Builder.
