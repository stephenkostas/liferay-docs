# Setting up the Fragment Generator

The Fragment Generator is a Yeoman generator. There are three prerequisites you 
will need installed to use it:

1. NodeJS 8+ (link)

2. NPM 6+ (link)

3. Yeoman 2+ (link)

## Installing Yeoman and the Fragment Generator

If you don't already have node.js and NPM installed, [follow these instructions](link). Once you have them installed, installing the Fragment 
Generator only takes a couple steps.

1.  From the command line, run `npm-install -g yo` to install Yeoman.

2.  Run, `npm-install -g generator liferay-fragments` to install the Fragment 
    Generator.
    
Now run the generator to create your initial project:

1.  From the workspace location that you want to use for your project, run
    `yo liferay-fragments`.
    
2.  Follow the prompts and answer the questions to set your project name.

Congratulations, you have setup the Fragment Generator, and can now begin 
fragment development.
