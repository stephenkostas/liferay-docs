# Liferay Fragments Generator

Page Fragments are a powerful tool for designing and creating content. 
@product@ provides tools in Site Administration for creating [Page Fragments] (link to user docs), 
but, since they are made up of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, you can also create 
them yourself using your preferred tools.

To streamline fragment development, @product-ver@ provides command line tools 
for generating, importing, and exporting fragments and fragment collections.
