# Recycle Bin [](id=recycle-bin)

How many times have you deleted something only to realize it was a mistake? Does
the app you're working on have a delete function? If so, you can add the
ability to move items into a recycle bin. Have you been looking for an easy way
to implement this capability in your app? Fortunately, you can, with Liferay's
[Recycle Bin](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/recycling-assets-with-the-recycle-bin).

The Recycle Bin tutorials use code from Liferay's [Jukebox Portlet](https://github.com/liferay-labs/jukebox-portlet)
to demonstrate implementing the Recycle Bin in an app. The Jukebox Portlet
plugin encompasses three portlets: Songs, Albums, and Artists. These portlets
work together, letting the Jukebox user upload songs to the portal. You can
categorize the songs by album and artist. You can move the Jukebox portlet's
songs and albums to and from the Recycle Bin. 

Using the Jukebox Portlet as an example, you'll learn to implement recycling
capabilities in your application.
