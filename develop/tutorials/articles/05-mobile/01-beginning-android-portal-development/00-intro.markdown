# Beginning Android Development for Your Portal [](id=beginning-android-development-for-your-portal)

Getting started with Liferay Screens for Android is a straightforward process. 
This series of Learning Path articles walks you through creating an Android app 
and preparing it to interact with the Guestbook portlet developed in the 
[Liferay MVC Learning Path](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/writing-a-liferay-mvc-application). 
Since Liferay Screens uses the Liferay Mobile SDK to make remote service calls, 
you'll build a Mobile SDK for the Guestbook portlet (the Guestbook Mobile SDK). 
You'll then install this Mobile SDK, and Screens, in your Android project. 
You'll also learn about the Android app's design, and implement authentication 
with Login Screenlet. 

The full list of topics covered in this section of the Learning Path are as 
follows:

1.  Setting up the Guestbook portlet
2.  Building the Guestbook Mobile SDK
3.  Creating the Android project
4.  Installing the Guestbook Mobile SDK and Liferay Screens in the Android 
    project
5.  Designing Your App
6.  Using Login Screenlet for Authentication

When you finish, you'll be ready to start developing your first Screenlet.
