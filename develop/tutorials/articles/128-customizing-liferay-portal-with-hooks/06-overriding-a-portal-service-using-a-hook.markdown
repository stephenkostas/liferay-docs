# Overriding a Portal Service Using a Hook [](id=overriding-a-portal-service-using-a-hook)

Liferay Portal and its core portlets offer a host of services that you can
programmatically invoke from local and remote clients. One only needs to look at
Portal's [service API](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/service/package-summary.html)
or the APIs of its portlets, like the
[Document Library services API](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portlet/documentlibrary/service/package-summary.html),
to see that Liferay is chock-full of useful access points. But you may encounter
situations in which you want to modify the behavior of these services. 

To do this, you may be tempted to extend a service interface directly. But there
are problems inherent with this approach. Fix packs later added to the product
may modify the interface (e.g., adding a new method to the service). If you've
implemented the API directly, your implementation may not account for the
modified interface. As a result, the patch could break your customization
plugin. Don't worry--Liferay has provided a safe way to customize its services. 

All the functionality provided by Liferay is enclosed in a layer of services
that are accessed by the controller layer in its portlets; this architecture
lets you change how a Liferay core portlet behaves without changing the
portlet itself. Liferay generates dummy wrapper classes for all its service
interfaces. For example, `UserLocalServiceWrapper` is created as a wrapper for
`UserLocalService`, a service interface for adding, removing, and retrieving
user accounts. If you extend the wrapper class, you can alter the service's
behavior, and your customization can be safeguarded from being broken by any
future patches to the interface. 

This tutorial shows you how to modify a portal service using a hook. By the end
of this tutorial, you'll have a hook plugin that overrides a Liferay service. 

## Implementing the Portal Service Override [](id=implementing-the-portal-service-override)

Hook plugins are the best tool for leveraging this architecture to customize
portal service behavior. To modify the functionality of a service from a hook,
you create a class that extends the service wrapper class, override the methods
you want to modify, and instruct Liferay to use your service class to override
those of the default class. 

You can follow these steps to override any Liferay service from your own
hook plugin: 

1.  Create a Liferay Hook plugin project in a
    [Liferay Plugins SDK project](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/creating-a-hook-project-in-the-plugins-sdk)
    or
    [Maven project](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/developing-liferay-hook-plugins-with-maven). 

2.  Create a class that extends the wrapper class of the service interface you
    want to override. 

    To create the extension class from Liferay IDE/Developer Studio, open your
    project's `liferay-hook.xml` file, which is found in the `docroot/WEB-INF/`
    folder. Select the `liferay-hook.xml` file editor's *Overview* mode tab and 
    select  *Service Wrappers* from the editor's outline. Select *Add a Service
    Wrapper* in the editor's main area to bring up the Service Wrapper Detail
    options. 

    ![Figure 1: Liferay IDE's Hook Configuration editor comes with custom service wrapper creation and editing capabilities.](../../images/hook-service-wrappers.png)

    In the Service Wrapper Detail screen, click the `Browse` icon at the right of
    the Service Type text field and select the service class you want to
    override. In the Service Impl text field, you can enter the fully qualified
    class name of your service wrapper extension class and click the `Create` icon
    to the right of the text field. This creates the extension class you entered
    and opens it in Liferay IDE. 

    ![Figure 2: Creating wrapper extensions is easy. You enter the name of your service implementation class and click the *Create* icon to create it for overriding the service.](../../images/hook-create-service-wrapper-impl.png)

    You can alternatively create your wrapper extension class manually in your
    favorite editor. 

    The initial wrapper extension class that Liferay IDE creates is virtually a
    blank canvas on which you can add your custom override methods. The wrapper
    class refers to Liferay's default implementation for the service. By
    calling the wrapper's methods via the `super.[methodName](...)` in your
    custom method implementations, you invoke the underlying default
    implementation. 

	The code below is from an example custom service implementation class named
    `MyUserLocalServiceImpl.java` that overrides the `UserLocalService` by
    extending `UserLocalServiceWrapper`. Note that its constructor calls the
    parent class constructor. A new implementation of the service's
    `deleteUser(...)` method has been added for holding custom logic. The parent
    class' version of the method, which invokes the underlying default
    implementation, is called at the end of the custom method. Calling the
    parent class method is optional but is a common practice to leverage
    Liferay's default implementation. 

        package com.liferay.sample.hook;
        
        import com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalService;
        import com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceWrapper;
        
        public class MyUserLocalServiceImpl extends UserLocalServiceWrapper {
        
            public MyUserLocalServiceImpl(UserLocalService userLocalService) {
                super(userLocalService);
            }
        
            @Override
            public com.liferay.portal.model.User deleteUser(long userId)
                throws com.liferay.portal.kernel.exception.PortalException,
                    com.liferay.portal.kernel.exception.SystemException {
        
                // TODO Add your custom implementation of the method here
        
                // Optionally, you can call Liferay's default implementation via the wrapper
        
                return super.deleteUser(userId);
            }
        }

    Now that you've created your wrapper extension class, you can add methods to
    it to override Liferay's implementation of the service interface.  

    +$$$

    **Note:** On deployment, the wrapper class extension is loaded in the hook's
    class loader, which means the extension can access any other class included in
    the same WAR file but *cannot* access Liferay's *internal* classes.

    $$$

2.  You must specify your custom service implementation class in the 
    `liferay-hook.xml` file. On creating wrapper extension classes using Liferay
    IDE's Hook Configuration editor, Liferay IDE automatically specifies the
    service implementation class in the `liferay-hook.xml` file. If you create
    your wrapper extension class manually, you must also manually specify the
    service implementation class in a `<service></service>` element within the
    `<hook></hook>` element. See the `liferay-hook.xml` file's
    [DTD](http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-hook_6_2_0.dtd) for details. 

    For example, here's what a wrapper extension specification to
    `UserLocalService` can look like: 

		<hook>
			<service>
				<service-type>com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalService</service-type>
				<service-impl>com.liferay.sample.hook.MyUserLocalServiceImpl</service-impl>
			</service>
		</hook>

3.  [Deploy](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/deploying-plugins) your hook to
    your portal. 

Your hook substitutes the service's default behavior with the behavior of your
custom implementation. 

There are other Liferay services that you may need to extend to meet advanced
requirements. Here are just a few services that you may want to customize:

- [`OrganizationLocalService`](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/service/OrganizationLocalService.html):
  Adds, deletes and retrieves organizations. Also
  assigns users to organizations and retrieves the list of organizations of a
  given user. 
- [`GroupLocalService`](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/service/GroupLocalService.html):
  Adds, deletes and retrieves sites. 
- [`LayoutLocalService`](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/service/LayoutLocalService.html):
  Adds, deletes, retrieves and manages pages of sites, organizations and users. 

For a complete list of available services and their methods, check the Javadocs
for
[Liferay Portal 6.2 Services](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/service/package-summary.html)
or browse <http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/> for Javadocs on the
services of any of Liferay Portal's core portlets. To access Javadocs for a
different version of Liferay, visit <http://docs.liferay.com/portal>, select the
Liferay Portal version, and click on the *Javadocs* link.

**Note:** To modify a portal utility class, you can extend
the utility's base implementation in a hook. But first, check Liferay's
[`portal.properties`](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html)
file to see if there's an option for specifying an extension to the utility. For
example, to customize the behavior of Liferay's 
[`SanitizerUtil`](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/kernel/sanitizer/SanitizerUtil.html)
class, you can extend the
[`BaseSanitizer`](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs-all/com/liferay/portal/kernel/sanitizer/BaseSanitizer.html)
class with your custom implementation. Then you'd set the
[`sanitizer.impl`](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html#Sanitizer)
property to the fully qualified name of your implementation class.
