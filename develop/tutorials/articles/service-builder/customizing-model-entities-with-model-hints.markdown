# Customizing Model Entities With Model Hints [](id=customizing-model-entities-with-model-hints)

If you've already used Service Builder to define your model entities and have
implemented business logic for creating and modifying those entities, you might
have some ideas for helping users to submit valid model entity data. For
example, suppose you're working on a calendar app where users can select a date
for a calendar event. How can you specify that only future dates are selectable?
Easy! Use *portlet model hints*! Liferay Service Builder's portlet model hints
provide a single place in your portlet project where you can specify entity data
restrictions. Portlet model hints are specified in a single file called
`portlet-model-hints.xml` in your project's `docroot/WEB-INF/src/META-INF`
folder. Liferay calls them *model hints* because they suggest how entities
should be presented to users. Portlet model hints let you to configure how the
AlloyUI tag library, `aui`, shows model fields. As Liferay Portal displays form
fields in your application, it first checks the model hints you specified and
customizes the form's input fields based on these hints. Model hints can also be
used to specify the size of the database columns used to store the entities and
to specify other entity details.

Note: Service Builder generates a number of XML configuration files in your
project's `docroot/WEB-INF/src/META-INF` folder. Service Builder uses most of
these files to manage Spring and Hibernate configurations. Don't modify the
Spring or Hibernate configuration files; your changes will be overwritten the
next time Service Builder runs. However, you can safely edit the
`portlet-model-hints.xml` file. 

<!-- The following example is not working on Liferay 6.2 GA1 - JR
For example, if you want to limit users to selecting dates in the future, you'd
set a `year-range-past` hint to `false` for that field in your
`portlet-model-hints.xml` file. It would look like the following tag:

    <field name="date" type="Date">
        <hint name="year-range-past">false</hint>
    </field>

-->

Let's look at the model hints file that Service Builder generated for the
Guestbook portlet. Examine your project's
`docroot/WEB-INF/src/META-INF/portlet-model-hints.xml` file. Service Builder
created the `portlet-model-hints.xml` file with the following contents:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>

    <model-hints>
        <model name="com.liferay.docs.portlet.eventlisting.model.Guestbook">
            <field name="guestbookId" type="long" />
            <field name="companyId" type="long" />
            <field name="groupId" type="long" />
            <field name="userId" type="long" />
            <field name="createDate" type="Date" />
            <field name="modifiedDate" type="Date" />
            <field name="name" type="String" />
            <field name="comment" type="String" />
        </model>
        <model name="com.liferay.docs.portlet.eventlisting.model.GuestbookEntry">
            <field name="guestbookEntryId" type="long" />
            <field name="companyId" type="long" />
            <field name="groupId" type="long" />
            <field name="userId" type="long" />
            <field name="createDate" type="Date" />
            <field name="modifiedDate" type="Date" />
            <field name="name" type="String" />
            <field name="guestbookId" type="String" />
            <field name="date" type="Date" />
            <field name="comment" type="String" />
        </model>
    </model-hints>

<!-- The above model elements should include the uuid String field? - Jim -->

The root-level element is `model-hints`. All your model entities are represented
by `model` sub-elements of the `model-hints` element. Each `model` element must
have a `name` attribute specifying the fully-qualified model class name. Each
model has `field` elements representing its model entity's columns. Lastly, each
`field` element must have a name and a type. Each `field` element's names and
types correspond to the names and types specified for each entity's columns in
your project's `service.xml` file. Service Builder generates all these elements
for you, based on `service.xml` file. 

To add hints to a field, add a `hint` tag inside its `field` tag. For example,
you can add a `display-width hint` to specify the pixel width that should be
used when displaying the field. The default pixel width is 350. To show a
String field with 50 pixels, we could nest a `hint` element named
`display-width` and give it a value of `50` for 50 pixels. Here's an example of
using the `display-width` hint in a `field` element: 

    <field name="name" type="String">
        <hint name="display-width">50</hint>
    </field>

In order to see the effect of a hint on a field, you must run Service Builder
again and redeploy your portlet project. Changing the `display-width` doesn't
actually limit the number of characters that can be entered into the `name`
field; it's just a way to control the width of the field in the AlloyUI input
form. 

To configure the maximum size of a model field's database column (i.e., the
maximum number of characters that can be saved for the field), use the
`max-length` hint. The default `max-length` value is 75 characters. If you
wanted the `name` field to persist up to 100 characters, you'd add a
`max-length` hint to that field: 

    <field name="name" type="String">
        <hint name="display-width">50</hint>
        <hint name="max-length">100</hint>
    </field>

Remember to run Service Builder and redeploy your portlet project after updating
the `portlet-model-hints.xml` file. 

So far, we've mentioned a few different hints. The following table describes the
portlet model hints available for use.

I wanted to get a complete list of model hints used in portal. I found the
ModelHints interface and then searched for where (*.java, *.js, *.jsp) it was
referenced. It led me to portal-web/docroot/html/taglib/ui/input_field/page.jsp.
I found some more hints and added them to the table above.

I'm not sure what the `check-tab` hint does. Would be worth asking the UI team.

Liferay Portal has its own model hints XML configuration file called
`portal-model-hints.xml` which is in Liferay's `portal-impl/classes/META-INF`
folder. Liferay's model hints configuration file contains many hint examples,
so you can reference it when customizing your `portlet-model-hints.xml` file. 

You can use the `default-hints` element to define a list of hints to be applied
to every field of a model. For example, adding the following element inside a
model element applies a `display-width` of 300 to each field: 

    <default-hints>
        <hint name="display-width">300</hint>
    </default-hints>

You can define `hint-collection` elements inside the `model-hints` root-level
element to define a list of hints to be applied together. A hint collection
must have a name. For example, Liferay's `portal-model-hints.xml` defines the
following hint collections:

    <hint-collection name="CLOB">
        <hint name="max-length">2000000</hint>
    </hint-collection>
    <hint-collection name="URL">
        <hint name="max-length">4000</hint>
    </hint-collection>
    <hint-collection name="TEXTAREA">
        <hint name="display-height">105</hint>
        <hint name="display-width">500</hint>
        <hint name="max-length">4000</hint>
    </hint-collection>
    <hint-collection name="SEARCHABLE-DATE">
        <hint name="month-nullable">true</hint>
        <hint name="day-nullable">true</hint>
        <hint name="year-nullable">true</hint>
        <hint name="show-time">false</hint>
    </hint-collection>

You can apply a hint collection to a model field by referencing the hint
collection's name. For example, if you define a `SEARCHABLE-DATE` collection
like the one above in your `model-hints` element, you can apply it to your
Event model's date field by using a `hint-collection` element that references
the collection by its name:

    <field name="date" type="Date">
        <hint-collection name="SEARCHABLE-DATE" />
    </field>

As always, remember to run Service Builder and redeploy your project after
updating your `portlet-model-hints.xml` file.

Suppose you wanted to use a couple of model hints in the Guestbook portlet.
You'd start by providing users with an editor for filling in their comment
fields. If you wanted to apply the same hint to multiple entities (e.g. to the
Guestbook entity and to the GuestbookEntry entity), you could define it as a
hint collection. Then you could reference the hint collection in each entity. 

To define a hint collection, add a `hint-collection` element inside the
`model-hints` root element in the `portlet-model-hints.xml` file. For example:

	<hint-collection name="COMMENT-TEXTAREA">
		<hint name="display-height">105</hint>
		<hint name="display-width">500</hint>
		<hint name="max-length">4000</hint>
	</hint-collection>

To reference a hint collection for a specific field, add the `hint-collection`
element inside of the `field` element of the field:

	<field name="comment" type="String">
		<hint-collection name="COMMENT-TEXTAREA" />
	</field>

<!-- The following example is not working on Liferay 6.2 GA1 - JR
The last hint is one that makes sure the user has no option to select a year
from the past. Replace the event entity's date field with the following date
field as specified below:

	<field name="date" type="Date">
		<hint name="year-range-past">false</hint>
	</field>

-->

After defining hint collections and adding hint collection references, rebuild
your services using Service Builder, redeploy your portlet project, and check
that your the hints defined in your hint collection have taken effect. For the
Guestbook example, you should check that the size of the comment text area has
changed as specified in the model hints.

<!-- We don't actually use the <hint name="editor">true</hint> for the
description textarea - JR

Well, you've learned the art of persuasion through Liferay's model hints. Now,
you can not only influence how your model's input fields are displayed but you
can also can set its database table column sizes. You can organize hints, insert
individual hints directly into your fields, apply a set of default hints to all
of a model's fields, or define collections of hints to apply at either of those
scopes. You've picked up the "hints" on how Liferay portlet model hints specify
how portlet data is displayed!
