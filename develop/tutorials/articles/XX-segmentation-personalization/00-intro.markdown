# Customizing Segmentation and Personalization

Segmentation and Personalization dynamically displays content to users based on 
the criteria that you define. Out of the box, you can define configure numerous 
properties to define user segments and use those to display personalized 
content with Liferay's core applications. In this section, you'll learn how to
customize Segmentation and Personalization and integrate it with your own 
applications.

In previous versions of Liferay the experience personalization  was contained 
in the Audience Targeting application which needed to be installed separately. 
In @product-ver@ those features are part of Liferay's core.

There are two main ways of customizing Segmentation and Personalization covered 
in this section:

1.  You can take custom entity types that have been defined as Liferay Assets 
    and allow their display to be managed through Segmentation and 
    Personalization.

2.  You can create custom criteria for defining segments.
