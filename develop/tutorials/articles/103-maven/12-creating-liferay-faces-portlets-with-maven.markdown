# Developing Liferay Faces Portlets with Maven [](id=developing-liferay-faces-portlets-with-maven)

If you're unfamiliar with the Liferay Faces project, it's important to know that
Liferay Faces is an umbrella project that provides support for the JavaServer
Faces (JSF) standard in Liferay Portal. Thus, Liferay Faces portlets and JSF
portlets are closely related. Visit the 
[JSF-related learning path](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/writing-a-jsf-application-using-liferay-faces)
for further details on JSF portlets and the Liferay Faces project. 

This tutorial explains the Liferay Faces portlets generation process using
Maven, and the anatomy of a JSF portlet. 

<!-- Make sure the JSF learning path link above is updated once it has been
created. -Cody -->

You'll begin creating a Liferay Faces portlet plugin next. 

## Creating a Liferay Faces Portlet Plugin [](id=creating-a-liferay-faces-portlet-plugin)

To create your Liferay Faces portlet plugin project, follow the 
[Creating Liferay Maven Plugins from Liferay IDE](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/creating-liferay-maven-plugins-from-liferay-ide)
tutorial or the
[Creating Liferay Maven Plugins from the Command Line](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/creating-liferay-maven-plugins-from-the-command-lin)
tutorial, making sure to select *Portlet* as the plugin type and *JSF 2.x* as
the portlet framework. Lastly, you'll be required to select a JSF component
suite. 

A Liferay Faces portlet can be built to use one of several different JSF
component suites, 
including [*RichFaces*](http://richfaces.jboss.org/),
[*PrimeFaces*](http://primefaces.org/),
[*Liferay Faces Alloy*](https://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/alloy),
the [*JSF Standard*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Faces) suite, and
[*ICEfaces*](http://www.icesoft.org/java/projects/ICEfaces/overview.jsf). Each
JSF component suite has an archetype that is used in creating the portlet.

**Tip**: If you're using Maven's
Archetype command line tool to generate your portlet project, you can filter on
the group ID `liferay`, or even the group ID/artifact ID combination
`liferay:portlet`, to find the Liferay portlet archetypes more easily.

It's helpful to familiarize yourself with a Liferay Faces portlet plugin
project's directory structure. You can explore its anatomy next. 

## Anatomy [](id=anatomy)

A portlet project created from the
`com.liferay.maven.archetypes:liferay-portlet-jsf-archetype` has the following
directory structure: 

- jsf-portlet-plugin/
    - src/
        - main/
            - java/
            - resources/
                - Language_[locale].properties
                - log4j.properties
            - webapp/
                - css/
                    - main.css
                - views/
                    - view.xhtml
                - WEB-INF/
                    - faces-config.xml
                    - liferay-display.xml
                    - liferay-hook.xml
                    - liferay-plugin-package.properties
                    - liferay-portlet.xml
                    - portlet.xml
                    - web.xml
                    - weblogic.xml
                - icon.png
    - pom.xml

Maven creates the `src/main/java/` directory automatically. It holds the
portlet's Java source code (e.g., `com.liferay.sample.SamplePortlet.java`), and
`portlet-plugin/src/main/webapp` holds its web source code. If you've created
any portlet plugins using the Plugins SDK, you might have noted it uses a
different directory structure. 

The following table illustrates the differences in the locations of the Java
source code and web source code for a Maven project and a Plugins SDK project: 

Location    | Maven project     | Plugins SDK project   |
----------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
Java source | `src/main/java`   | `docroot/WEB-INF/src` |
Web source  | `src/main/webapp` | `docroot`             |
---

Congratulations! You now know how to create Liferay Faces portlets that can
leverage one of several powerful JSF frameworks.
