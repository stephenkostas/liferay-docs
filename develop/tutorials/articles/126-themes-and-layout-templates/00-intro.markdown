# Themes and Layout Templates [](id=themes-and-layout-templates)

Do you want to transform the look and feel of your Liferay Portal? Create your
own Liferay Theme! Themes are hot deployable plugins unique to a site. With
themes, you can create whatever user interface you want for your site. In this
section of tutorials, you'll learn how to develop themes.

Layout Templates define how portlets are arranged on a page. These are
CSS-based containers where portlets live in the body of the page. Liferay Portal
comes with several built-in layout templates, but if you require a more complex
page layout, you'll want to create your own custom layout templates. You'll
learn how to develop layout templates in these tutorials too.
