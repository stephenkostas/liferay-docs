for the Guestbook application. When you're finished, authorized clients, such as
mobile devices, will be able to consume your application's web services. This

interact with your application. For example, Android or iOS developers could
create Guestbook apps which allow users to view and add entries to your
Guestbook application from their smartphones or tablets. 

Read on to learn how to create consumable services for your Liferay
