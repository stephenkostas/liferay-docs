# Displaying Approved Workflow Items [](id=displaying-approved-workflow-items)

To display only approved entities, you'll add a new *finder*, then a *getter*
that uses it in your service layer. The new methods will serve the purpose of
getting only entities with the proper workflow status. Then you can display only
those entities in the portlet's search container. Service Builder makes this
easy.

## Adding a Finder for the Entry [](id=adding-a-finder-for-the-entry)

If you look in `docroot/html/guestbook/view.jsp`, you'll see that entries are
retrieved from the database for display in the search container using the
following code:

    <liferay-ui:search-container>
        <liferay-ui:search-container-results
            results="<%=EntryLocalServiceUtil.getEntries(scopeGroupId,
                            guestbook.getGuestbookId(), searchContainer.getStart(),
                            searchContainer.getEnd())%>"
            total="<%=EntryLocalServiceUtil.getEntriesCount(scopeGroupId,
                            guestbook.getGuestbookId())%>" />
        ...
        </liferay-ui:search-container-row>
        <liferay-ui:search-iterator />
    </liferay-ui:search-container>

The getter methods used are those responsible for populating the Search
Container. They need to include the workflow status as an additional parameter. 

First, you need a finder method to expose. Open `service.xml` and add this
tag below the current list of finders for the `Entry` entity:

    <finder name="G_G_S" return-type="Collection">
        <finder-column name="groupId"></finder-column>
        <finder-column name="guestbookId"></finder-column>
        <finder-column name="status"></finder-column>
    </finder>

Run Service Builder.

## Exposing the Entry's New Finder in the Service Layer [](id=exposing-the-entrys-new-finder-in-the-service-layer)

It's all well and good to have a finder, but the portlet's service layer needs
to expose it to be of any use. Open `EntryLocalServiceImpl` and delete these
getter methods: 

	public List<Entry> getEntries(long groupId, long guestbookId, int start,
			int end) throws SystemException {
		return entryPersistence.findByG_G(groupId, guestbookId, start, end);
	}
	
	public int getEntriesCount(long groupId, long guestbookId) throws SystemException {
		return entryPersistence.countByG_G(groupId, guestbookId, WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED);
	}

Add these methods:

	public List<Entry> getEntries(long groupId, long guestbookId, int status, int start,
			int end) throws SystemException {
		return entryPersistence.findByG_G_S(groupId, guestbookId, WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED, 
            start, end);
	}
	
	public int getEntriesCount(long groupId, long guestbookId, int status) throws SystemException {
		return entryPersistence.countByG_G_S(groupId, guestbookId, WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED);
	}

Since there's nowhere in the portlet where an `Entry`'s workflow status should
be ignored, it's a best practice to replace the current getters with appropriate
ones.

## Updating the View Layer to Display Approved Entries [](id=updating-the-view-layer-to-display-approved-entries)

Back in the `view.jsp`, find the following tag, which currently retrieves the
entries from the database for display in the search container:

	<liferay-ui:search-container-results
		results="<%=EntryLocalServiceUtil.getEntries(scopeGroupId,
						guestbook.getGuestbookId(), searchContainer.getStart(),
						searchContainer.getEnd())%>"
		total="<%=EntryLocalServiceUtil.getEntriesCount(scopeGroupId,
						guestbook.getGuestbookId())%>" />

Replace the above tag with this one:

	<liferay-ui:search-container-results
		results="<%=EntryLocalServiceUtil.getEntries(scopeGroupId,
						guestbook.getGuestbookId(), WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED, searchContainer.getStart(),
						searchContainer.getEnd())%>"
		total="<%=EntryLocalServiceUtil.getEntriesCount(scopeGroupId,
						guestbook.getGuestbookId(), WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED)%>" />

As you'd expect, the calls to `getEntries` and `getEntriesCount` now call the
updated methods you created in the local service implementation, so that the
search container is only populated with approved entries. 

Open `init.jsp` and add the following import:

    <%@ page import="com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowConstants" %>

The `Entry` entity is now fully enabled for workflow. Do the same thing for
`Guestbook`s next.

## Adding a Finder for the Guestbook [](id=adding-a-finder-for-the-guestbook)

In the portlet's `view.jsp`, you can see the code that displays `Guestbook`s in
the `<aui:nav cssClass="nav-tabs">` section. Here's the call to the local
service implementation that gets the list of `Guestbook`s from the database:

     List<Guestbook> guestbooks = GuestbookLocalServiceUtil
                .getGuestbooks(scopeGroupId);

This call doesn't yet account for the workflow status of the `Guestbook`s.

Open `service.xml` again and add the following finder, below the existing
finder tags for the `Guestbook`:

    <finder name="G_S" return-type="Collection">
        <finder-column name="groupId"></finder-column>
        <finder-column name="status"></finder-column>
    </finder>

Run service builder. 

## Exposing the Guestbook's New Finder in the Service Layer [](id=exposing-the-guestbooks-new-finder-in-the-service-layer)

Open `GuestbookLocalServiceImpl`. Find the current method with the signature
`public List<Guestbook> getGuestbooks(long groupId)`. Delete it and add this
one in its place:

	public List<Guestbook> getGuestbooks(long groupId, int status) throws SystemException {
		return guestbookPersistence.findByG_S(groupId, WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED);
	}

Run Service Builder. Leave the other getter methods alone, even though they
don't account for workflow status. The Guestbook Admin portlet should display
all of a site's `Guestbook`s, regardless of workflow status, and these getters
are used to populate its search container. What you will do later is add a
column to the Guestbook Admin portlet's Search Container to display guestbooks'
statuses. 

## Updating the View Layer to Display Approved Guestbooks [](id=updating-the-view-layer-to-display-approved-guestbooks)

Open `view.jsp`, and find this method call:

     List<Guestbook> guestbooks = GuestbookLocalServiceUtil
                .getGuestbooks(scopeGroupId);

Replace it with this one:

     List<Guestbook> guestbooks = GuestbookLocalServiceUtil
                .getGuestbooks(scopeGroupId, WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED);

All you did here was add the parameter that marks a `Guestbook`
as approved in the workflow.

Now open the `view_search.jsp`, located in `docroot/html/guestbook`. Find the
scriptlet, denoted by `<%`,that comes right after the closing `</aui:form>` tag.
As in the `view.jsp`, replace the current line starting with `List<Guestbook>
guestbooks...` with this one:

     List<Guestbook> guestbooks = GuestbookLocalServiceUtil
                .getGuestbooks(scopeGroupId, WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED);

Now both entities are enabled for workflow, and the Guestbook portlet's view
layer is modified accordingly. But what about the Guestbook Admin Portlet that's
accessed through the portal's Site Administration section? What should the
strategy be there?

## Modifying the Guestbook Admin Portlet to Display Workflow Status [](id=modifying-the-guestbook-admin-portlet-to-display-workflow-status)

The Guestbook Admin portlet currently displays the `Guestbook`s for a site in a
Search Container, which is how all of Liferay's portlets work. Like those
portlets, you should include the workflow status as a column in the Search
Container.

![Figure 1: The Message Boards Admin portlet displays the workflow status of its entities.](../../../images/message-boards-admin.png)

Open `docroot/html/guestbookadmin/view.jsp` and find the section where both
columns of the search container are populated:

		<liferay-ui:search-container-column-text property="name" href="<%= viewGuestbook %>" />

		<liferay-ui:search-container-column-jsp
	            path="/html/guestbookadmin/guestbook_actions.jsp"
	            align="right" />

You need a column in between the *Name* column and the column containing the
*Actions* button, so replace the above columns with these ones:

		<liferay-ui:search-container-column-text property="name" href="<%= viewGuestbook %>" />

		<liferay-ui:search-container-column-text name="status" >
            <aui:workflow-status showIcon="<%= false %>" showLabel="<%= false %>"
                status="<%= guestbook.getStatus() %>" />
        </liferay-ui:search-container-column-text>

		<liferay-ui:search-container-column-jsp
	            path="/html/guestbookadmin/guestbook_actions.jsp"
	            align="right" />

You've added a new `<liferay-ui:search-container-column-text>` tag, defining a
*Status* column. The `<aui:workflow-status>` tag makes it easy to convert the
`int` value of `guestbook.getStatus()` into a `String` representing the status
label value (e.g., the int *02* becomes *Pending*). It's displayed with some
styling that matches that of Liferay's core portlets.

Note that you didn't change the `getter` method for one that only returns
`Guestbook`s marked as approved in the workflow. In the Guestbook Admin
Portlet, you're allowing all `Guestbook`s to be displayed with their workflow
status.

## Testing Workflow [](id=testing-workflow)

To test that workflow is working properly for both entities, log in to the
portal and go to *Admin* &rarr; *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration*
&rarr; *Workflow*. Click on *Default Configuration* and select 
*Single Approver* for both *Entry* and *Guestbook*.

![Figure 2: Enable workflow for entities in the Control Panel.](../../../images/test-workflow-1.png)

After saving your selections, navigate to the Guestbook Portlet and try to add a
new Guestbook and then a new Entry. If you are the portal administrator, you
will receive notifications that you have items waiting in the workflow. The
entities won't appear in the portlet until you assign them to yourself and then
approve them in the workflow. There are a couple of additional things to note:

- When workflow is disabled in the Control Panel, the `status` of the entities
  is automatically set as approved, and they appear as soon as they are added,
  just like before you enabled them for workflow.
- In the Guestbook Admin Portlet, the *Status* field is always displayed, even
  when workflow is disabled. You'll just see that added `Guestbook`s are always
  marked as *Approved*, with no review necessary and no workflow notifications
  sent.

![Figure 3: The Guestbook Admin portlet now displays the workflow status of each `Guestbook` in the site.](../../../images/guestbook-admin.png)

Your Guestbook Application now supports workflow!
