\chapter{Preface}

Welcome to the world of Liferay Portal! This book was written for anyone who has
any part in setting up, using, or maintaining a web site built on Liferay
Portal. For the end user, it contains everything you need to know about using
the applications included with Liferay. For the administrator, you'll learn all
you need to know about setting up your site with users, sites, organizations,
and user groups, as well as how to manage your site's security with roles. For
server admins, it guides you step-by-step through the installation,
configuration, and optimization of Liferay Portal, including setting it up in a
clustered, enterprise-ready environment. Use this book as a handbook for
everything you need to do to get your Liferay Portal installation running
smoothly, and then keep it by your side as you configure and maintain your
Liferay-powered web site.

\section{What's New in the Second Edition}

Liferay Portal visually changed a lot in the 6.2 release. This is reflected in 
all the updated screenshots in this book. Of course, everything from the old
book has been updated to reflect the release of Liferay Portal 6.2. We also
have complete coverage of Liferay's new features, such as web content folders, 
the Recycle Bin, Application Display Templates, and more. 

There is, of course, coverage of Liferay Marketplace as well as the Plugin
Security Manager. Mobile devices are first-class citizens in Liferay Portal 6.2, 
and we cover how to serve sites to mobile devices, using responsive layouts 
and mobile device rules. We cover the new, split Control Panel UI, which is 
much more convenient, especially for those who want to grant access to content 
functionality, but not administration of the overall portal. We also cover the 
enhancements to staging and the many new settings for sites, including 
membership management, site hierarchies, and more. 

The new release is feature-packed, and so the documentation must be also: we
have over 700 pages of goodness awaiting you in these pages. 

\section{Conventions}

The information contained herein has been organized in a way that makes it easy
to locate information. The book has two parts. The first part, 
\textit{Using Liferay Portal}, describes how to configure and use a freshly 
installed Liferay Portal. The second part, \textit{Deploying Liferay Portal}, 
is for administrators who want to install Liferay Portal and optimize its 
performance. 

Sections are broken up into multiple levels of headings, and these are
designed to make it easy to find information.

Source code and configuration file directives are presented monospaced, as
below.

\begin{verbatim}
If source code goes multi-line, the lines will be \

separated by a backslash character like this.

\end{verbatim}

\textit{Italics} are used to represent links or buttons to be clicked on in a

\chapter{What is Liferay?}\label{what-is-liferay}

Let's attempt some mind reading: you're reading this because you need to
build a website. You're thinking about using Liferay Portal for your
site, or you've already decided to use it and you want to learn all
about it. Either way, you've come to the right place. What you'll find
here is that Liferay Portal is the right decision, and we'll be happy to
tell you all the reasons why. But since you might be in a rush, we'll
give you all the reasons in a nutshell right here, and then you can read
the details in the rest of the chapter.

The reasons to use Liferay Portal for your website are simple: it
provides a robust \emph{platform} to serve your site to all clients, be
they desktop, mobile, or anything in between; it provides all the
standard \emph{applications} you need to run on your site; and it
provides an easy to use development \emph{framework} for new
applications or customization. In addition to this, Liferay Portal is
developed using an open source methodology, by people from around the
world. The code base is solid, and has been proved to be reliable and
stable in mission critical deployments in diverse industries.

But don't just take our word for it. Let us \emph{show} you how Liferay
does all this. Probably the first thing you want to do after you install
Liferay Portal to manage your site is to get your content published.
Let's dive right in and see how Liferay Portal handles that task.

\section{Building a site with Liferay Web
Content}\label{building-a-site-with-liferay-web-content}

When you log into Liferay and look at its default screen, one thing
should jump out at you right away: it's built for all clients that
access the web, not just desktop browsers.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-preview.png}
\caption{\\Figure 1.1: When designing pages, Liferay includes a preview
that lets you see how it would look when displayed at resolutions for
computers, tablets, and phones.}
\end{figure}

Another thing to notice is that all the page controls are right there
for you. For example, to add something, you click the \emph{+} button,
and then you can add any kind of content Liferay supports. The
interface--particularly in Liferay 6.2--has been designed to get out of
your way and let you do your work.

Liferay WCM scales to work for the tiniest of sites all the way up to
the largest of sites. For example, you can click that \emph{Add} button,
choose \emph{Web Content Article}, and immediately start typing content
into a WYSIWYG editor, in place. Or you can set up Liferay Portal to
host many different web sites, all with their own domain names. Each
site can take advantage of a separate staging server, where content and
pages are created by teams of people using structures and templates, and
updates to the production server are published on a schedule, only after
having gone through a multi-step approval process.

That's powerful.

By default, Liferay Portal starts with a single site that has a single
page. You can build any website you wish out of this, complete with
multi-nested page hierarchies, as the figure below shows.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-page-hierarchy.png}
\caption{\\Figure 1.2: Liferay's page hierarchies are easy to create,
using a tree structure that's familiar to anyone who has used a file
manager.}
\end{figure}

These pages can have any layout you like: Liferay Portal ships with
several built-in, and you can create your own custom layouts and deploy
them easily. Pages can be added, removed, or reordered any time, and you
have the full flexibility of all the HTML page attributes, such as meta
tags and robot file declarations, that you need.

Pages are also integrated with Liferay's powerful permissions system, so
it's easy to restrict access to certain portions of your site. You can
give individual users sites of their own, with public pages that have
their content and blog, and private pages that contain their calendars
and email.

If you're running a large website that has lots of different sub-sites
for individuals and groups, you can use page templates and site
templates. The former enables you to set up templates of pages with
predefined layouts and applications already on them, and the latter
enables you to create a whole site made up of multiple, predefined
pages.

There's even more. If you have a very large site, you might need
multiple people to work on it. And you certainly don't want the live
site changing before your users' eyes. For that reason, Liferay Portal
provides a feature called \emph{staging} that lets you place your
changes in a holding area while they're being worked on. You can have a
local staging server, where the staged site resides on the same server
as the live site, or you can have a remote staging server, where all web
content work happens on a separate server from your live site. In either
case, when you're ready, site changes can be pushed to the live site,
either manually or on a schedule.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/web-content-staging-publish.png}
\caption{\\Figure 1.3: Staging supports publishing manually or on a
schedule.}
\end{figure}

Liferay Portal's web content creation tools are easy and intuitive to
use at all levels. If you need only basic content management
capabilities for your site, you can jump right in. You can add the Web
Content Display application anywhere in your page layout and enter
content in place. It's easy to go from this basic level of content
management to more sophisticated levels of functionality.

For example, suppose you wanted to build a news-oriented site. Most of
the content you'll publish is an article of some kind. Liferay's web
content management system lets you create a \emph{structure} for this,
so that you can capture all the information from your writers that you'd
need in an article. The figure below shows what this structure might
look like to a journalist who'd be entering his or her article into the
system.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-content-structure.png}
\caption{\\Figure 1.4: Structures allow you to specify exactly the type of
data that makes up your content. You can also include tooltips to help
your users understand what each field is for.}
\end{figure}

As you can see, you can use structures to make sure writers provide the
title of the story, what type of story it will be, and the byline (i.e.,
the writer's name). You've made sure that all the relevant information
for the story is captured in the system.

Web content is one example of an \emph{asset}. Assets can have meta-data
attached to them, and that meta-data is used to aggregate similar assets
together in searches or as published content. One way to do this in the
example above is to tag and categorize stories so they can be found more
easily by users.

This is just one example, of course. But the concept is applicable to
any kind of site you'd want to build. For example, if you were building
a site for a zoo, you could use web content structures to help users
enter data about animals in the zoo, such as their common names, their
scientific names, their species, their locations in the wild, and more.

When it comes time to publish content, structures are combined with
\emph{templates}. Templates are instructions for how to display
structures, written most of the time in Freemarker or Velocity--both of
which are well-known templating languages used for mixing HTML with
programmatic elements. Because of this, they're very easy to write and
can help you ensure that your site has a consistent look and feel.

There is much more to web content. You can create abstracts, schedule
when content is published and when it should be taken down (or
reviewed), define related assets, and more.

This is just the web content portion of Liferay's content management
system. Liferay Portal is also great at managing file-based content.

\subsection{Keeping track of documents, images, video, and
more}\label{keeping-track-of-documents-images-video-and-more}

It's rare to find in an open source project a full-featured content
management system. Most of the time, you'll find web content management
systems and file-based content management systems as separate projects.
Liferay Portal, however, provides you with both. As shown above, the web
content management system is as robust as any other you'll find, and its
file-based content management system is the same.

Liferay Portal keeps the UI of its file-based content management system
in an application called \emph{Documents and Media Library}. This
application resides on the Site Administration page or can be added to
any page, and, as shown below, looks very much like the file manager
that you're already familiar with from your operating system.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-docs-and-media.png}
\caption{\\Figure 1.5: Liferay Portal's Documents and Media library was
purposefully designed to be familiar to anyone who uses a computer.}
\end{figure}

Like a file manager, you can browse files and folders in nested
hierarchies. You can also mount other repositories that you might have
in your environment, such as Documentum (enterprise subscribers only) or
any system that implements Content Management Interoperability Services
(CMIS). It provides previews of just about every document type you can
think of. And, like a file manager, you can upload, copy, and move files
between folders by dragging and dropping them. Of course, if you still
want to use your operating system's file manager, you can, because
Liferay's Documents and Media library supports WebDAV, using the same
credentials you use to log in to Liferay.

Liferay Portal's Documents and Media library, however, is much more
robust than a file manager is, because it's a full content management
system. You can define ways of classifying files that may be of
different types, but are meant for the same, overarching purpose.

For example, \emph{metadata sets}, are groups of fields describing
attributes of a file. One that ships with the product is called
\emph{meeting metadata}, and it contains fields such as Meeting Name,
Date, Time, Location, Description, and Participants. This is a generic
set of fields that go together and that you'd want to use as a group.
You can create as many of these as you want.

For files, you can define \emph{document types}. They provide a more
natural way of working with files. For example, you might create a
document type called Meeting Minutes. The file format doesn't matter:
whether it's a Microsoft Word document, an HTML file, or a text file,
the document contains meeting minutes. Once you've created the document
type, you can attach the Meeting Metadata set that contains many of the
fields you'd want, and you can also add extra fields, such as a field
for action items. When users want to add files containing their notes
for meeting minutes, they can also add all the relevant metadata about
the meeting (such as the time, location, and action items). This
captures the context information that goes with the document, and it
provides a much more natural way of working with documents than just
dumping them into a shared file system.

Of course, the system goes much further than this. Folders can be set so
that only certain document types can be added to them. Workflow rules
can also be added to folders to run files through an approval process
that you define. In short, Liferay's file-based content management
system gives you all the features you need to manage and share files in
a group.

Many Liferay Portal users see it as a robust content management system,
and they use it primarily for that purpose. Now, hopefully, you can see
why. We'll cover the system in-depth in the body of this book, but for
now we need to look at some of the other ways you can use Liferay
Portal, starting with its fantastic collaborative tools.

\section{Using Liferay Portal as a collaborative
platform}\label{using-liferay-portal-as-a-collaborative-platform}

Many sites have grown organically. You may have grown your community by
using separate tools: first a forums application, and then a wiki for
collaborative documentation, and maybe even a chat application. It can
be hard (and error-prone) to integrate all these applications so your
users can use them seamlessly. Thankfully, Liferay includes a suite of
collaborative applications, and they're all integrated together.

Liferay Portal offers every standard collaborative application that's
available. These applications range from personal productivity
applications like a calendar and email, to community-building
applications like message boards, polls, and wikis.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-message-boards.png}
\caption{\\Figure 1.6: Liferay Portal's message boards are as fully
featured as any standalone forum application, with the added benefit
that they're integrated with the rest of the system.}
\end{figure}

This is a suite of integrated applications with all the features of
similar, standalone applications. For example, Liferay Portal's message
boards include categories and subcategories, message threads, captcha,
RSS feeds, email notification, posting via email, and much more. But
more than this, the applications are integrated with the rest of Liferay
Portal's framework. Users log in, and their profiles are used
automatically by the message boards and all the other collaborative
applications. And as we'll see later, functionality from the built in
applications can be added to your own to provide features like comments
in your own software, and you don't have to write any code to do it.

Liferay Portal's wiki is another example of a full-featured
collaborative application. It has support for authoring pages in a
WYSWYG editor, or more advanced users can use the easy-to-learn standard
Wiki Creole syntax. Users can comment on wiki articles, and it keeps a
full history of every change that's been made, allowing users to revert
back to any change. It also supports RSS feeds (just about every Liferay
application does) so you can subscribe to see new articles as they are
posted. Each site can have one or more wikis, and each wiki can have one
or more top-level nodes.

One important feature of all the collaborative applications--as well as
web content and documents--is the Recycle Bin. If users delete content
that needs to be restored later, you don't have to find it in your
backups: it's in the Recycle Bin.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/recycle-bin-overview.png}
\caption{\\Figure 1.7: The Recycle Bin can hold any kind of content.}
\end{figure}

We could go through all of Liferay Portal's collaborative applications,
but let's save that for the body of the book. Liferay Portal's suite of
collaborative applications includes a blog (complete with blog
aggregation features so you can publish multiple users' blog entries in
one place), a chat application for users who are online at the same
time, message boards, a wiki, a knowledge base that you can use to
publish a library of technical articles, a polling system you can use to
have users vote on certain questions, and personal productivity
applications like a calendar and email.

Liferay Portal includes every application you'll need to enable users to
collaborate. Next, we'll see how you can use Liferay Portal as a social
platform.

\section{Using Liferay as a social
platform}\label{using-liferay-as-a-social-platform}

Whether you plan to build a social network or enable social applications
as part of your overall user experience, Liferay Portal has the tools to
make those features work for you. Starting with a suite of
applications--including a profile summary, activities feeds, social
requests, a wall, and more--and rounding things out with an API to
handle relationships between users as well as publish their activities
to each other, Liferay Portal helps you implement common features of
social networks.

Social relationships in Liferay Portal are ideally suited for everything
from public social networks to enabling social features in your
corporate Intranet. Users can form relationships with one another,
allowing them to see updates from those whose activity they need to
track. That's far more powerful than having them subscribe to multiple
individual RSS feeds or visit multiple profiles, because the system
keeps track of the updates from those with whom you have a relationship,
automatically.

More than this, however, Liferay is a great integration platform for
social applications. It fully supports the OpenSocial framework. You can
publish gadgets you find online, or you can use Liferay Portal's
built-in OpenSocial gadget editor to create and serve your own
OpenSocial gadgets.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-opensocial-gadget-editor.png}
\caption{\\Figure 1.9: Liferay Portal's OpenSocial gadget editor lets you
rapidly create social applications that can be served across the web to
any other OpenSocial container.}
\end{figure}

Liferay Portal also supports the creation of Facebook applications; in
fact, no additional coding is necessary to publish your Liferay
applications on Facebook (you would, of course, need to use Facebook's
API to use Facebook-specific features like posting on users' timelines).
All you need to do is get an API key and canvas page URL from Facebook.

As you can see, Liferay Portal is built with social applications in
mind. It's highly likely, however that you also have your own
application you need to run on your website. The Liferay Portal platform
is ideal for the web application you're considering writing. In addition
to this, Liferay Portal is easily configured to be used as a shared
hosting platform for multiple web sites. Let's look at the benefits you
can reap by using Liferay Portal in these ways.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-facebook-integration.png}
\caption{\\Figure 1.10: Any Liferay application can be published to
multiple social networks with a few clicks.}
\end{figure}

\section{Using Liferay as a web
platform}\label{using-liferay-as-a-web-platform}

We can't even begin to imagine what you're thinking of building, but
whatever it is, you're going to put your heart and soul into it.
Building it on Liferay's web platform can give you a leg up. It provides
everything you need to support your application, so you can concentrate
solely on what \emph{you're} building, and not the rest of the features
your users expect will come along with it.

Imagine your application for a moment. Does it require users to register
on your site? Can users comment on content contained in your
application? Is there something that users can tag or categorize? If you
think about the layout of the application, would it benefit from
modularization? Could you make use of a rich JavaScript framework with
many components built into it? How about security--will you need to make
information available to some users, but not to all users? Liferay
Portal has all of this and more available to developers.

Liferay Portal's development framework is a great help when you're
building a web application. While the framework itself is covered in
other resources such as the \emph{Liferay Developer Network} or
\emph{Liferay in Action}, the strengths of Liferay as a platform are
also apparent once you've finished writing your application.

For example, bug fixes to your applications are easy to apply, because
Liferay applications are hot deployed to the running server. Liferay's
Marketplace gives you a ready-made shopping center for your
applications. And Liferay's web services and JSON architecture make it
easy for you to share data from your applications with other systems
running on different platforms.

You get all this--not to mention the automatic Facebook and OpenSocial
integration mentioned above--with Liferay's development platform. It's a
very powerful platform, and certainly worth your investigation.

\subsection{A great integration
platform}\label{a-great-integration-platform}

If you're building an enterprise system, portals were designed in the
first place to be a single point of entry to your users' applications
and content. Since Liferay Portal integrates well with user directories
such as LDAP and Active Directory, and single sign-on systems such as
SAML and OpenSSO, it fits well into your enterprise systems. This allows
you to use it as an integration platform for existing applications.

Liferay Portal, since it adheres to the JSR standard for portlets, was
designed from the ground up for application integration. You can add any
application installed on the system to any page in the portal. You can
make use of APIs provided by other systems to integrate their data into
an application window in Liferay. And applications you create with
Liferay's Service Builder API are web service-enabled from the start.

\subsection{Hosting multiple sites on Liferay
Portal}\label{hosting-multiple-sites-on-liferay-portal}

Liferay Portal excels as a multi-site hosting platform. You can use it
to host multiple sites under the same overall architecture, or you could
host several completely different websites based solely on Liferay's
ability to serve multiple instances of itself from the same physical
installation.

In the first scenario, Liferay Portal's Sites architecture lets you
create multiple, different websites that have public and/or private sets
of pages and as many pages within those sets as you'd like. Users can
join and leave open sites with one click. Some sites can be defined as
restricted or private, and users can't access those unless they're added
by site administrators. All of these sites can have canonical domain
names such as baseballcards.liferay.com or progrock.liferay.com.

Using this construct, you can build anything from Facebook, to Yahoo
Groups, to SourceForge, to the now-defunct-but-once-loved Geocities.
There is no limit to the number of sites you can have: some Liferay
installations have only one or two, but others have many thousands. For
those larger installations, Liferay Portal contains a complete site
membership management framework that lets administrators manage
automatic site members for groups of users. It really is built to scale
to the size you need.

In the second scenario, Liferay Portal lets you create completely
separate instances of itself from the same installation. Users, groups,
organizations, sites, and roles from each instance are kept completely
separate. If a user registers for a user id on one instance, he or she
would have to register as a new user on another instance as well.

This lets you host many different, separate websites from one Liferay
Portal installation. Users of each instance have access to the same
powerful content management, collaboration, social, and web development
platform that they'd have if they were operating from a single,
standalone installation.

Okay, so maybe this still isn't enough for you. Let's see how you can
customize Liferay Portal so that it looks and operates exactly the way
you've envisioned for your site.

\section{Extending and customizing Liferay for your own
needs}\label{extending-and-customizing-liferay-for-your-own-needs}

Beyond using Liferay as a development platform for new applications,
Liferay Portal has also been designed to be extended and modified. As an
open source project, its source code is available, but Liferay Portal's
developers have designed the product to make it easy to build whatever
you want out of it.

The first (and easiest) way of customizing parts of Liferay Portal is
with Application Display templates. These let you change the way
built-in applications look. For example, if you don't like the Documents
and Media Library's file manager view with large icons, you can create
an Application Display template that shows documents in a list view. If
you don't like the layout of the Blogs portlet, you can change it so
that it has the look you want.

Liferay Portal goes far beyond this, though. Special software components
called \emph{hook} and \emph{ext} plugins enable developers to change
any aspect of Liferay's interface and behavior--without having to modify
any of Liferay Portal's source code. This provides you all the benefits
of building your site from scratch, but without all the effort to
actually build from scratch. If you want to make a change to the user
registration screens, add support for a proprietary single sign-on
mechanism that you've written, add a feature to the message boards
application, or anything else, you can make those customizations. And if
you're a developer, we're sure you know that it's a whole lot easier to
customize something that almost does things exactly the way you want
than it is to write that feature from scratch. With Liferay Portal, you
\emph{can} have your cake and eat it too.

\section{Summary}\label{summary}

So what is Liferay? As you can see, it's hard to describe, because it
does so much. What we've essentially done is say it's a totally awesome
content and document managing, user collaborating, socially enabling,
application developing, corporate integrating, completely customizable
platform for building the Internet. If we'd said that up front, you'd
probably have doubted us. Hopefully now, you can see that it's true.

If you're interested in using Liferay Portal for \emph{your} product,
continue reading. We'll go through all of these features (and more that
we couldn't mention) throughout the rest of the book.

\chapter{Web Content Management}\label{web-content-management}

Liferay's Web Content Management system allows non-technical users to
publish content to the web without having advanced knowledge of web
technology or programming of any sort. Liferay WCM empowers you to
publish your content with a simple point and click interface and it
helps you to keep your site fresh. You'll find yourself easily creating,
editing and publishing content within just a few minutes of being
exposed to its features. But Liferay WCM doesn't sacrifice power for
simplicity. If need be, you can use your developer skills to create
complex presentation layer templates that make your content ``pop'' with
dynamic elements. Once these templates have been deployed into the
portal, your non-technical users can manage content using these
templates as easily as they would manage static content. All of this
makes Liferay WCM an appropriate choice both for sites with only a few
pages and for sites with gigabytes of content.

Nearly all Liferay users use Liferay's Web Content Management system
(WCM). After all, all every web site has content that needs to be
managed. Liferay's WCM empowers you to manage all the content on your
site quickly and easily within your browser. Beyond managing existing
content, Liferay's WCM lets users easily create and manage everything
from simple articles containing text and images to fully functional web
sites. Web publishing works alongside Liferay Portal's larger collection
of applications, which means you can add shopping cart functionality,
visitor polls, web forms, site collaboration tools and more. Everything
is done with our collection of easy-to-use tools with familiar rich-text
editors and an intuitive interface.

In Liferay, you can create multiple sites within a single portal
instance. Each site can have distinct sets of users, content, and
application data. Once set up, non-technical users can administer a
site. Liferay's fine-grained permissions system ensures that your
content and applications can be accessed only by appropriate sets of
users. To manage a site, no programming is required. With Liferay's WCM,
you have the ability to create, edit, stage, approve, and publish
content with easy-to-learn yet powerful tools. Liferay's WCM streamlines
the content creation process for end users. It's much faster to use
Liferay's WCM than it would be to create all the content for your site
in HTML. WCM is integrated with Liferay's services so advanced template
developers can use them to query for data stored elsewhere in Liferay.
In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Leveraging Liferay's multi-site capabilities to create and administer
  sites
\item
  Creating pages and selecting page types and layout templates
\item
  Creating and publishing web content
\item
  Exporting and importing content
\item
  WCM workflow
\item
  Site memberships and permissions
\item
  Page and content permissions
\end{itemize}

By the time we're done, you should be able to apply all these concepts
to your own content. To demonstrate Liferay's Web Content Management
features, we'll create and manage content on the portal for the
ambitious (and fictitious) \emph{Lunar Resort} project. The Lunar Resort
project specializes in facilitating lunar vacations. It provides space
shuttle transportation from the Earth to Moon and back, offers the use
of a state-of-the-art recreational facility enclosed by a large,
transparent habitat dome, and even rents out lunar rovers. Once you're
familiar with Liferay WCM, you'll wonder how the Lunar resort's portal
could ever manage without it!

\section{Touring Liferay Portal's User
Interface}\label{touring-liferay-portals-user-interface}

Liferay Portal's user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive.
Across the top is what's known as the \emph{Dockbar}, a series of links
that appear based on the permissions of the logged-in user. There are
four sections in the Dockbar: \emph{Admin}, \emph{My Sites},
\emph{Notifications}, and the \emph{User} section.

The Admin section gives you access to Liferay Portal's Site
Administration interface, as well as to the Control Panel. Both of these
are explained in more detail later in this book. Site administration in
particular can be done directly on the page as well, as will be
described.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/dockbar.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.1: The Dockbar provides convenient access to Liferay
Portal's functions.}
\end{figure}

The My Sites section provides a list of the sites which the logged-in
user can access. These appear as a drop down list. Next are
Notifications. The Notifications icon shows the unread notifications you
have. You are notified upon receiving a private message, an invitation
to join a site, a social connection request, or an event reminder.
Alerts and announcements created via the Alerts or Announcements
applications are accessible via the Notifications icon.

Finally, the user section shows the users name and provides links to the
user's profile (his or her publicly-accessible pages), dashboard (his or
her private pages), account settings, and a sign out link.

On the left side of the page are three icons: one for add, one for
previews, and one to show or hide the edit controls if you have
administrative access to the page. All of these are explained later in
this chapter.

Anything else you see on the page is provided by the theme that is
installed. This includes site navigation and application windows, called
\emph{portlets}. Let's jump in and start creating the site we'll use for
this book.

\section{Setting up the Lunar Resort Example
Portal}\label{setting-up-the-lunar-resort-example-portal}

Suppose that you've been assigned the task of building a web site for an
innovative new company called Lunar Resort, Inc. You've decided to take
advantage of Liferay Portal and its rapid deployment features as well as
its ability to get a fully functional, content-rich web site with
integrated social features up and running in little time. We can get you
started. We'll walk you through the creation of the Lunar Resort's web
site, starting by creating and publishing some simple content using
Liferay's built-in WYSIWYG editor. In the next chapter, we'll take
advantage of Liferay's robust structure editor. Then we'll use templates
to display the content and then explore some of the advanced publishing
features such as the built-in workflow and Asset Publisher.

First, a little housekeeping. If we're going to be the Lunar Resort, our
portal should also be called \emph{Lunar Resort}. To set general
information about your portal like the name and mail domain, go to the
Control Panel and select \emph{Portal Settings} under the Configuration
heading. You could set up the configuration for the Lunar Resort as
follows.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-changing-settings.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.2: You can change the portal settings by navigating to
the Control Panel and selecting \emph{Portal Settings}.}
\end{figure}

You can also customize the logo in the top left corner of every page by
selecting \emph{Display Settings} under the \emph{Miscellaneous} tab on
the panel to the right. Once you've made the changes, we can begin
creating pages. With most products, you would learn what the software
can do in terms of setting up your users and security model and then
start building your system. You'd design your infrastructure and get
your server environment up and running while your developers write the
applications that live on your web site. With Liferay Portal, however,
you start farther ahead. Liferay Portal is more than just a
\emph{container} for applications with a robust security model. It
already includes many of the applications you'll need, out of the box.
These applications are ready to go and are integrated with the rest of
Liferay's user management and security features.

\section{Leveraging Liferay's Multi-site
Capabilities}\label{leveraging-liferays-multi-site-capabilities}

As stated in chapter 1, a site is a set of pages that can be used to
publish content or applications. Sites can be independent or they can be
associated with an organization and serve as the website for that
organization. With Liferay, you can create as many different sites as
you like within the context of a single portal.

You can use sites in Liferay to build many different kinds of websites.
Whether you're building a large corporate website, a company intranet,
or a small site designed to facilitate collaboration among team members,
Liferay's framework provides all the tools you need. To support
different kinds of collaboration and social scenarios, Liferay's sites
provide three membership types:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open: Users can become members of the site at any time. Users can join
  sites from the \emph{My Sites} portlet.
\item
  Restricted: Users can request site membership but site administrators
  must approve requests in order for users to become members. Requests
  can be made from the \emph{My Sites} portlet.
\item
  Private: Users are not allowed to join the site or request site
  membership. Private sites don't appear in the \emph{My Sites} portlet.
  Site administrators can still manually select users and assign them as
  site members.
\end{itemize}

In addition to these memberships, when a site is associated with an
organization, all the users of that organization are automatically
considered members of the site.

Members of a site can be given additional privileges within the site by
using Liferay's permission settings. It is also possible to assign
different roles within the site to different members. This can be done
through \emph{site roles} which are defined equally for all sites or
\emph{teams} which are unique for each site.

As of Liferay 6.2, sites can be organized hierarchically, just like
organizations. The difference between sites and organizations, of
course, is that sites are used to organize pages, content, application
data, and users (via site memberships) whereas organizations are only
used to group users. Content sharing is available for sites within the
same hierarchy. For instance, if a parent site has a document called
\emph{Lunar Goals and Objectives} and would like for all its subsites to
have a copy, the parent site's administrator can enable content sharing
to automatically share the document with its subsites, instead of having
to send each site the document individually. Also, content sharing
privileges can be set to let every site administrator share content
across sites they manage.

Please refer to the Sites Admin Portlet section of Liferay's
\texttt{portal.properties} file for a list of relevant configurable
properties. For example, the
\texttt{sites.content.shar\-ing.with.children.enabled} property allows you
to disable content sharing between sites and subsites, disable it by
default while allowing site administrators to enable it per site, or to
enable it by default while allowing administrators to disable it per
site.

The Sites Directory portlet is a configurable portlet that can allow
users to view a hierarchy of sites and subsites. It enables users to
navigate to any of the displayed sites. To use this portlet to display
site hierarchies, add it to a page, open its Configuration window, and
under Display Style, select \emph{List Hierarchy}. The Site Map portlet
is another configurable portlet that's intended to help users navigate
among pages within a site. When configuring this portlet, a site
administrator can select a root page and a display depth. Just as sites
can be organized hierarchically, so can the pages within a site. The
display depth of the Site Map portlet determines how many levels of
nested pages to display.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/site-directory-site-map.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.3: The Site Directory portlet can allow users to
navigate between sites organized hierarchically. The Site Map portlet
can allow users to navigate among pages of site organized
hierarchically.}
\end{figure}

Liferay's sites have two categories of pages called page sets. There are
two kinds of page sets: public pages and private pages. A site can have
only public pages, only private pages or both. Private pages can only be
accessed by site members. Public pages can be accessed by anyone,
including users who haven't logged in. It's possible to restrict access
to pages at the page set level or at the level of individual pages
through the permission system. Public pages and private pages have
different URLs and can have different content, applications, themes, and
layouts.

Building a corporate intranet is a typical use case for Liferay sites. A
corporate intranet could have sites for all the organizations in the
company: Sales, Marketing, Information Technology, Human Resources and
so on. But what about the corporate health and fitness center? That's
something everybody in the company, regardless of organization, may want
to join. This makes it a good candidate for an open and independent
site. Similarly, the home page for a corporate intranet should probably
be placed in an open independent site so any member of the portal can
access it.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} Prior to Liferay 6.1, there were two ways of creating
sites: organizations and communities. This has been simplified to
provide more ease of use and allow for more flexibility. The main role
of organizations is still to organize the users of the portal in a
hierarchy but they can also have associated sites. Communities can still
be created through independent sites but the new name reflects the fact
that sites can be used for many different purposes besides communities.

\end{roundedframe}
For other kinds of web sites, you may want to use independent sites to
bring users together who share a common interest. If you were building a
photo sharing web site, you might have independent sites based on the
types of photos people want to share. For example, those who enjoy
taking pictures of landscapes could join a Landscapes site and those who
enjoy taking pictures of sunsets could join a Sunsets site.

Liferay always provides one default site, which is also known as the
main site of the portal. This site does not have its own name but rather
takes the name of the portal. By default the portal name is
\emph{liferay.com} but this value can be changed through the simple
configuration of the setup wizard. The portal name can also be changed
at any time through the Control Panel within \emph{Portal Settings}.

\subsection{Creating and Managing
Sites}\label{creating-and-managing-sites}

Sites can be created through the Control Panel by a portal
administrator. Liferay's Control Panel provides an administrative
interface for managing your portal. There are four main sections of the
Liferay's Control Panel: Users, Sites, Apps, and Configuration. In this
chapter, we'll learn how to use the Control Panel to manage sites. In
the next chapter, we'll learn about using the Control Panel to manage
site templates and page templates. For information about the Apps,
Users, and Configuration sections of the Control Panel, please see
chapters 14, 16, and 17 of this guide.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} Prior to Liferay 6.2, the Control Panel included
interfaces both for site administration and for portal administration.
In Liferay 6.2, these interfaces have been separated. If you're signed
in as an administrator, you can access the Liferay 6.2 Control Panel by
clicking \emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Control Panel}. To manage a single site,
navigate to the site by clicking on \emph{My Sites} and clicking on the
site's name. Then click on \emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site Administration}.
The Site Administration interface allows to configure site settings and
manage the pages, content, and users of the site.

\end{roundedframe}
To add a site, click on \emph{Sites} under the Sites section of the
Control Panel and then click \emph{Add}. If there is at least one site
template available, a dropdown menu appears. Site templates provide a
preconfigured set of pages, portlet applications, and content that can
be used as the basis of a site's public or private page set. To create a
site from scratch, select \emph{Blank Site}. Otherwise, select the name
of the site template you'd like to use. If you opt to create a site from
a site template, you have to choose whether to copy the site template's
pages as your new site's public or private page set. If other site
templates are created, they will appear in the Add menu as they become
available. The following figure shows the form that needs to be filled
when creating a \emph{Blank Site}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-add-site-screen.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.4: The New Site window aids in your new site
development.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Name:} is the name of the site you wish to create.

\textbf{Description:} describes the site's intended function.

\textbf{Active:} determines whether a site is active or inactive.
Inactive sites are inaccessible but can be activated whenever a site
administrator wishes.

\textbf{Membership Type:} can be open, restricted or private. An open
site appears in the My Sites portlet and users can join and leave the
site whenever they want. A restricted site is the same except users must
request membership. A site administrator must then explicitly grant or
deny users' requests to join. A private site does not appear in the My
Sites portlet and users must be added to it manually by a site
administrator.

\textbf{Allow Manual Membership Management:} determines whether to allow
or disallow users to be manually added or removed from the site. By
default, manual site membership management is enabled. This allows
administrators to manually assign users to the site. It also allows
users to join open sites or request membership from restricted sites
using the My Sites portlet. For organization sites, manual site
membership management is disabled, by default. This causes organization
members to be automatically assigned membership following the
organization's membership policy. Also, because manual membership
management is disabled for organization sites, by default, the
\emph{Users} section of \emph{Site Administration} is unavailable. To
activate the \emph{Users} functionality for your organization site,
you'll need to check \emph{Allow Manual Membership Management} after
creating the organization site by navigating to its \emph{Site Settings}
menu.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

It's possible for site memberships to be handled automatically by a
membership policy. The membership policy can check various pieces of
information from each user, such as their first names, last names,
birthdays, job titles, organizations, and user groups. Using this
information, the site membership policy can automatically assign members
to the site. If your site will implement a membership policy, your site
administrators can disallow manual membership management for their site.
When the Allow Manual Membership Management option is disabled, the
\emph{Users} section of \emph{Site Administration} (Site Memberships and
Site Teams) is hidden, even from administrators.

\end{roundedframe}
\textbf{Directory Indexing Enabled:} allows site administrators to
browse the site's documents and media files and folders. For example, a
site administrator of a site called \emph{Lunar Resort} can browse
documents at \url{http://localhost:8080/documents/lunar-resort} if this
option is enabled.

\textbf{Parent Site:} lets you select a parent site for the site that's
being created. As of Liferay 6.2, sites can be organized hierarchically.
Using hierarchical sites provides a simplified way to manage site
memberships and site content sharing. For organizations that have
attached sites, the organization hierarchy should match the site
hierarchy. When you select a parent site, an additional option appears:
\emph{Limit membership to members of the parent site}. If this option is
enabled, the site's membership policy performs a check so that you can
only assign members to the current site if they're already members of
the parent site.

Once you've created a site, it appears in the Sites page of the Control
Panel. Once the site has been created you can specify more details about
the site using three categories: Basic Information, Search Engine
Optimization, Advanced, and Miscellaneous. We'll go into more detail for
your site's settings in the \emph{Site Settings} section later in the
chapter.

When creating a site from a site template, the initial form provides a
new option that lets you decide if you want to copy the pages from the
template as public pages or as private pages. By default, the site is
linked to the site template and changes to the site template propagate
to any site based on it. A checkbox appears that allows users to unlink
the site template if the user has permission to do so.

Now that our new site is created, lets learn how to create and manage
its pages.

\subsection{Creating and Managing
Pages}\label{creating-and-managing-pages}

You have a few options for accessing and configuring your site's page
editing interface. There are three interfaces to be aware of: \emph{Site
Pages}, \emph{Page}, and \emph{Edit Page}. These interfaces all deal
with your site's pages, however, each interface is configurable in a
different place and completes different objectives.

From the Site Administration page, your site pages can be accessed and
configured. If you're already on your desired site, you can reach the
Site Administration page by navigating to the \emph{Admin} tab in the
Dockbar and selecting \emph{Site Administration}. If you're not
currently on the site you'd like to edit, go to \emph{My Sites} in the
Dockbar and select your desired site. Once you're on the Site
Administration page, select \emph{Site Pages} (if necessary) under the
Pages tab from the left panel. You can also use the \emph{Pages}
shortcut which is also listed under the Admin tab.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-managing-site-pages.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.5: The \emph{Site Pages} interface allows you to edit
your site pages as a whole.}
\end{figure}

To add new pages to your site, click the \emph{Add} icon from the left
palette and select the \emph{Page} tab. This is the \emph{Page}
interface, which offers a plethora of options for your new page
including name, site layout, and site template.

To manage the specific page of the site you've navigated to, click the
\emph{Edit} icon from the left palette. This will only edit the specific
page you're currently on.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-managing-single-page.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.6: The \emph{Edit Page} interface allows you to edit
the current page you're on.}
\end{figure}

\emph{Site Pages} is an interface to view existing pages, create new
pages, view pages and export or import pages using Liferay Archive (LAR)
files. Note that you can switch between managing a set of pages and
managing a single page using the left-hand side navigation menu. Click
on \emph{Public Pages} or \emph{Private Pages} to manage the group or
click on an individual page to manage just that one. Switching views
like this changes the list of available tabs to the right. By default,
liferay.com, which we renamed to lunar-resort.com, contains a single
public page called \emph{Welcome}.

Liferay's page groups are always associated with sites. Even users'
personal pages are part of their personal sites. All pages belong to one
of two types of page sets: public pages and private pages. By default,
public pages are accessible to anyone, even non-logged in users
(guests). Private pages are accessible only to users who are members of
the site which owns the pages. This means the private pages of an
organization's site would only be viewable by site members and members
of the organization.

Regardless of whether the pages are public or private, Liferay uses the
same interface to manage them. Let's look at this interface more
closely.

\subsubsection{More Page Management
Tools}\label{more-page-management-tools}

From the Site Pages interface in Site Administration, you can add a page
to the site by clicking the \emph{Add Page} button. Because \emph{Public
Pages} is selected on the left, clicking \emph{Add Page} here adds a top
level page next to the Welcome page. You can, however, nest pages as
deeply as you like. To create a sub-page under the Welcome page, select
the \emph{Welcome} page first and then create your page. If you later
decide you don't like the order of your pages, you can drag and drop
them in the list to put them in whatever order you want. Let's go ahead
and add another top level page and name it \emph{Community}. We'll use
this page for the Recent Bloggers and Wiki portlets.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-add-page.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.7: You can add a page to your site by giving it a
name, page template, and page type.}
\end{figure}

When you create a new page, you can create either a blank page or a page
prepopulated with portlets from a page template. When you're entering
the name of the page, you can select from a list of page templates that
are currently available. To view the pages once you add them, click the
\emph{View Pages} button. This is how you'd populate your pages with
content and applications. This is covered in succeeding chapters. Page
types include \textbf{Layout}, \textbf{Panel}, \textbf{Embedded},
\textbf{Link to URL}, and \textbf{Link to a Page of This Site}. By
default, all pages are created as portlet pages but in some situations
you might want to use one of the other options.

\textbf{Layout:} the pages we're usually talking about. They have a
layout which you can drag and drop portlets into. Most of the pages you
create will be layout pages.

\textbf{Panel:} can have any number of portlets on them, as selected by
an administrator, but only one will be displayed at a time. Users select
which portlet they want to use from a menu on the left side of the page
and the selected portlet takes up the entire page.

\textbf{Embedded:} display content from another website inside of your
portal. An administrator can set a URL from in the page management
interface and that page will appear in the context and within the
navigation of your Liferay portal.

\textbf{Link to URL:} are just redirects to any URL specified by an
administrator. You can use URL pages to create links to pages belonging
to other sites of your portal or to pages of an external site. Use URL
pages cautiously since blind redirects create a poor user experience.

\textbf{Link to a Page of This Site:} creates a portal page which
functions as an immediate redirect to another page within the same site.
You can select which page to link to from a dropdown in the page
management interface. You could use a \emph{Link to a Page of This Site}
to place a deeply nested page in the primary navigation menu of your
site, for example.

To use the Edit Page interface to modify an existing page, navigate to
the left palette and select the \emph{Edit} icon. Notice that it's not
possible to add a new page. This is because you're only managing the
current page.

Once you've created pages and populated them with content, Liferay
provides a way for you to back them up to separate files. Let's see how
that works.

\paragraph{Backing up and Restoring
Pages}\label{backing-up-and-restoring-pages}

Next to the \emph{Add Page} button on the Site Pages screen, there are
two buttons labeled \emph{Export} and \emph{Import}. The Export button
allows you to export the your site's data as a single file, called a LAR
(Liferay Archive) file. When importing data into a site, it's best to
use a newly created site to avoid potential conflicts between the
existing site data and the data about to be imported. When exporting
site data, you can specify exactly what data should be included in the
LAR:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Site pages (you can select exactly which ones)
\item
  Page settings
\item
  Theme
\item
  Theme settings
\item
  Logo
\item
  Application configurations
\item
  Application content
\item
  Archived setups
\item
  User preferences
\end{itemize}

Once you've created a LAR file, you can import it into a site on another
Liferay server. The data included in the LAR file, including all the
site pages, will be imported into the site. Exporting and importing LARs
is a great way to take content from a site in one environment (say, a
development or QA environment) and move it all in one shot to a site on
another server. You can use LARs to import data onto production servers,
but you should not make this a regular occurrence. If you want to
regularly move pages from one server to another, you should use
Liferay's staging environment, which we discuss in chapter 3.

LARs can be a good way to back up your site's content. You can export
them to a specific location on your server which is backed up. If you
ever have to restore your site, all you need to do is import the latest
LAR file. However, please be careful! If there's any content that exists
both in the LAR and in the site that's importing the data, there may be
a conflict, and data could be corrupted. If you'd like to restore a
Liferay site using a LAR file, it's best to delete the site entirely,
create a new site with the same name as the old one (i.e., re-create the
site), and then import the LAR file into the new site. This way, there's
no chance for there to be a data conflict.

Liferay can handle some kinds of naming collisions when importing a LAR
file into a site. For example, suppose you're importing a LAR file into
a site and the LAR file has a page with a certain friendly URL. If an
existing page in the site has the same friendly URL there will be a
collision. Liferay resolves the collision by adding a number to the end
of the friendly URL and incrementing until there's no collision. This
behavior takes place for friendly URL translations as well. Similarly,
if importing a LAR into a site causes a category name collision, Liferay
renames the imported categories.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} LAR files are version dependent. You can't import a LAR
file that was exported from one version of Liferay into a Liferay server
that's running a different version of Liferay. Also, note that
periodically exporting LARs is \emph{not} a complete backup solution;
please refer to chapter 18 of this guide for information on backing up
Liferay.

\end{roundedframe}
Let's be good administrators and export a LAR file for backup purposes.
Click on the \emph{Export} button and then name the file
\texttt{lunarresortv1.lar}. Use the check boxes to determine what you'd
like to export. For this initial export, select everything. Note that if
you select one of the \emph{Choose} radio selectors or \emph{Change}
links, you're given checkboxes for options to choose. The applications'
content can also be selected for export, including the Documents and
Media Library, Message Boards, and Web Content assets. You can even
export the theme you're using!

Once you click \emph{Export}, your browser prompts you to save the file.
Once you have the file, you can copy it to a backup location for
safekeeping or import it into another installation of Liferay Portal. If
you must rebuild or wish to revert back to this version of your site,
you can import this file by clicking the \emph{Import} button from the
Site Pages dialog box, browsing to it and selecting it.

Next, we'll look at the options on the right side menu, starting with
Look and Feel.

\paragraph{Customizing the Look and Feel of Site
Pages}\label{customizing-the-look-and-feel-of-site-pages}

When you open \emph{Site Pages} from within Site Administration, it
defaults to the Look and Feel tab. On this tab, you're presented with an
interface that allows you to choose a theme for the current site. Themes
can transform the entire look of the portal. They are created by
developers and are easily installed using the Liferay Marketplace. Since
we don't have any themes beyond the default one installed yet, we'll use
the default theme for our pages.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-look-and-feel.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.8: The Look and Feel interface allows you to choose a
theme for the current site.}
\end{figure}

Many themes include more than one color scheme. This allows you to keep
the existing look and feel while giving your site a different flavor.
Change the color scheme from blue to green by selecting \emph{Dark}
under \emph{Color Schemes}. If you now go back to the site (by clicking
the left arrow in the top left corner of the Dockbar), you'll see some
parts of the page are now tinged with a darker hue.

If you apply a color scheme to a set of public or private pages, it is,
by default, applied to each page in the set. If, however, you click the
\emph{Edit Page} button from the left palette of a specific page, you
can select \emph{Define a specific look and feel for this page} from the
\emph{Look and Feel} tab to make the color scheme apply to this page
only. You can use this feature to choose a different color scheme for a
particular page than the one defined for the set of public or private
pages to which it belongs.

There are a few more configurable settings for your theme. You can
switch the bullet style between dots and arrows and you can choose
whether or not to show portlet borders by default.

Starting in Liferay 6.2, WAP related technologies have been deprecated.
In particular, the ability to modify themes for regular browsers and
mobile devices can now only be accomplished using Mobile Device Rules,
which can be found in the right menu. You can learn more about using
Mobile Device Rules in the \emph{Advanced Content Management} chapter.
You can enable the WAP functionality for your portal's Look and Feel
section by opening/creating your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file in
your \$\{LIFERAY\_HOME\} directory and setting
\texttt{mobile.device.styling.wap.enabled=true}. WAP functionality will
be completely removed from Liferay in the next release.

The \emph{CSS} section allows you to enter custom CSS that will also be
served up by your theme. In this way, you can tweak a theme in real time
by adding new styles or overriding existing ones.

The next option configures the logo that appears for your site.

\paragraph{Using a Custom Logo for a
Site}\label{using-a-custom-logo-for-a-site}

By default, the Liferay logo is used for your site pages' logo. If you
want to use your own logo for a specific site, use the \emph{Logo} tab.
Adding a custom logo is easy: select the Logo tab from the Site Pages
interface and browse to the location of your logo. Make sure your logo
fits the space in the top left corner of the theme you're using for your
web site. If you don't, you could wind up with a site that's difficult
to navigate, as other page elements are pushed aside to make way for the
logo.

In the logo tab, you can also choose whether or not to display the site
name on the site. If you check the box labeled \emph{Show Site Name} the
site name will appear next to the logo. This option is enabled by
default and cannot be disabled if the \emph{Allow Site Administrators to
set their own logo} option is disabled in \emph{Portal Settings}.
Removing the site name is not available for the default site -- only
newly created sites and user pages have the option to have the name
display.

\paragraph{JavaScript}\label{javascript}

If you click on \emph{JavaScript} from the Site Pages interface for a
page set (either Public Pages or Private Pages), you'll find a window
where you can enter JavaScript code the will be executed at the bottom
of every page in the site. If your site's theme uses JavaScript (as is
usually the case), it's best to add custom JavaScript code to the theme
and \emph{not} in this window. This way, all of your site's JavaScript
code remains in one place.

Using the JavaScript window of your site's Site Pages interface may be
useful if your site's theme does \emph{not} use JavaScript. In this
case, the JavaScript window of your site's Site Pages interface will
contain \emph{all} of your site's JavaScript and you can add some
dynamic features to your site's pages.

Next, let's look at an advanced feature of the Site Pages interface:
merging the current site's pages with the pages of the default site.

\paragraph{Advanced}\label{advanced}

If you click on \emph{Advanced} from the Site Pages interface for a
public page set, you'll find an option to merge the public pages of your
portal's default site with the public pages of the current site. If you
enable this option, the pages of the default site appear in the current
site's navigation bar, along with the current site's pages. Also, the
pages of the current site appear in the navigation bar of the default
site, along with the default site's pages. This ``merging'' of pages
only affects the list of pages in the default site's and the current
site's \emph{navigation bars}. This allows users to more easily navigate
from the current site to the default site, and vice versa. This option
can be enabled for the public pages of both personal sites and regular
sites.

Note that this ``merging'' of pages is not a ``hard merge''. For
example, suppose that the site administrators of twenty different sites
on your portal all enabled the \emph{Merge default site's public pages}
option. Would the pages of all these different sites be merged into each
site's navigation bar? No, that would make a mess! Instead, the portal
keeps track of the current \texttt{scopeGroupId} (the ID of the current
site) and the previous \texttt{scopeGroupId} (the ID of the previously
visited site). If the \emph{Merge default site's public pages} option is
enabled for either the current site or the previous site, the pages of
the default site are merged in the pages of the other site.

For example, suppose that your portal has three sites: the default site,
site A, and site B. All three sites have some public pages. Site A has
the \emph{Merge default site's public pages} option enabled, site B does
not. When a user first logs in, he's directed to the default site. The
\texttt{scopeGroupId} is that of the default site and there is no
previous \texttt{scopeGroupId}, so no additional pages appear in the
default site's navigation bar. Then suppose the user navigates to site
A. Site A has the \emph{Merge default site's public pages} option
enabled, so the default site's pages are added to site A's navigation
bar. Now if the user goes back to the default site, site A becomes the
previous site so site A's pages are added to the default site's
navigation bar. If the user navigates to site B, no additional pages
appear in site B's navigation bar because site B does not have the
\emph{Merge default site's public pages} option enabled. And if the user
navigates back to the default site, site B becomes the previous site,
and, again, since site B does not have the \emph{Merge default site's
public pages} option enabled, no additional pages are added to the
default site's navigation menu.

Next, let's examine how to configure individual pages.

\subsubsection{Changing Options for Individual
Pages}\label{changing-options-for-individual-pages}

When you use the \emph{Edit Page} interface for a single page, some
different options appear. Let's look at what these do.

\textbf{Details:} lets you name the page for any localizations you need,
set whether the page is hidden on the navigation menu, set an easy to
remember, friendly URL for the page, and select the page type. Plus you
can specify how portlets are arranged on a page. Choose from the
available installed templates to modify the layout. It's very easy for
developers to define custom layouts and add them to the list. This is
covered more thoroughly in both the \emph{Liferay Developer Network} and
in \href{http://manning.com/sezov}{\emph{Liferay in Action}}.

\textbf{SEO:} provides several means of optimizing the data the page
provides to an indexer that's crawling the page. You can set the various
meta tags for description, keywords and robots. There's also a separate
Robots section that lets you tell indexing robots how frequently the
page is updated and how it should be prioritized. If the page is
localized, you can select a box to make Liferay generate canonical links
by language. If you want to set some of these settings for the entire
site, you can specify them from the Sitemaps and Robots tabs of the
Manage Site Settings dialog box (see below).

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

In previous versions of Liferay, it was possible that a single page
could be indexed multiple times. In Liferay 6.1, all URLs that direct to
the same page will only create one entry in the index. Previously, the
simple URL
\emph{http://www.lunar-resort.com/web/guest/blog/-/blogs/themoon} and
different versions of the URL which provided additional information
about the referring page had different entries in the index. As of
Liferay 6.1, each asset (web content article, blog entry, etc.) has a
unique URL. From the search engine's point of view, this will make your
pages rank higher since any references to variations of a specific URL
will all be considered references to the same page.{]}

\end{roundedframe}
\textbf{Look and Feel:} lets you set a page-specific theme.

\textbf{JavaScript:} gives you the ability to paste custom JavaScript
code to be executed on this page.

\textbf{Custom Fields:} If custom fields have been defined for pages
(which can be done from the \emph{Custom Fields} page of the Control
Panel), they appear here. These are metadata about the page and can be
anything you like, such as author or creation date.

\textbf{Advanced:} contains several optional features. You can set a
query string to provide parameters to the page. This can become useful
to web content templates, which you'll see in the next chapter. You can
set a target for the page so that it either pops up in a particularly
named window or appears in a frameset. And you can set an icon for the
page that appears in the navigation menu.

\textbf{Mobile Device Rules:} allows you to apply rules for how this
page should be rendered for various mobile devices. You can set these up
in the \emph{Mobile Device Rules} section of Site Administration.

\textbf{Embedded Portlets:} only appears if you have embedded one or
more portlets on the page. To embed a portlet on a page, first look up
its portlet name in Liferay's \texttt{WEB\--INF/\-port\-let-custom.xml} file.
Portlet names in \texttt{portlet-custom.xml} are sometimes referred to
as portlet IDs. What we usually mean by ``portlet names,''
\texttt{portlet-custom.xml} refers to as ``display names''. Next, add a
web content display content to the page, create a new web content
article, switch to source, and paste in the following:

\begin{verbatim}
<runtime-portlet name="" />
\end{verbatim}

Then add the portlet name (ID) inside of the quotation marks, publish
the web content article, and select the article in the web content
display portlet. Once you've selected the new web content article, the
embedded portlet appears on the page.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-13pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Usually, you don't want the web content display portlet that you're
using to embed a portlet to be visible. To make the web content display
portlet invisible, click on the gear icon of the web content display
portlet, select \emph{Look and Feel}, set \emph{Show Borders} to
\emph{No}, and click \emph{Save}. Once you've refreshed the page, only
the embedded portlet will be visible.

\end{roundedframe}
\textbf{Customization Settings:} lets you mark specific sections of the
page you want users to be able to customize.

Next, we'll run practice modifying page layouts!

\subsubsection{Modifying Page Layouts}\label{modifying-page-layouts}

Page layouts allow you to arrange your pages so the content appears the
way you want it to. Liferay comes with many layouts already defined.
Developers can create more and they can be deployed to your portal for
your use.

To prepare for the portlets we'll soon be adding, let's change the
layout of the Collaboration page. To access layouts, select the
\emph{Edit} icon from the left palette and click the \emph{Details} tab
(if necessary).

Now, select the \emph{2 Columns (70/30)} layout and click \emph{Save}.
Once saved, you'll return to the page and it'll seem as though nothing
has happened. Once we start adding portlets, however, you'll notice the
page is now equally divided into two columns. You can stack portlets on
top of each other in these columns. There are, of course, more
complicated layouts available and you can play around with them to get
the layout you want.

Sometimes a particular layout is \emph{almost} what you want but not
quite. In this case, use the Nested Portlets portlet to embed a layout
inside another layout. This portlet is a container for other portlets.
It lets you select from any of the layouts installed in Liferay, just
like the layouts for a page. This gives you virtually unlimited options
for laying out your pages.

The next option we'll explore is page customizations.

\subsubsection{Page Customizations}\label{page-customizations}

With page customizations, any user with the appropriate permissions can
create personalized versions of any public page. Before users can create
personalized versions of pages, customizations must first be enabled by
an administrator. Administrators can activate or deactivate
customizations for any row or column on any page. When users customize a
page, they have the option to use either their version or the default
version of a page. Users can't see alternate versions of pages other
than their own.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-personal-customization.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.9: During page customization, individual columns
change colors to indicate whether they are selected or not.}
\end{figure}

To activate page customizations, click the \emph{Edit Page} button from
the left palette and select the \emph{Customization Settings} tab. Then
select \emph{Show Customizable Sections} to view and modify sections on
your page.

When an administrator activates page customizations for a page, any
portlets that are in a \emph{Customizable} row or column can be moved
around the page or removed from the page. Users can add new portlets of
their own choosing to these columns of the page and can also customize
portlet configurations. If at any time users determine they don't like
their customizations, they can click \emph{Reset My Customizations} to
revert their pages back to the default. For more information about page
customizations, please refer to the Page Customizations section of
chapter 6.

Now that you know how to enable page customizations, let's look at the
settings for the site as a whole.

\subsubsection{Configuring Site
Settings}\label{configuring-site-settings}

As with Site Pages, you can access Site Settings by navigating to Site
Administration and clicking \emph{Site Settings} from the Configuration
section on the left panel. You can also select the Site Administration
sub-tab \emph{Configuration} from the \emph{Admin} drop-down.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/web-content-site-settings.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.10: The Site Settings window offers a plethora of
options for your site.}
\end{figure}

You'll find options to specify details and metadata about your site, set
up friendly URLs and virtual hosts, configure search engine optimization
settings, turn staging on or off and specify a Google Analytics ID.
Let's take a closer look.

\textbf{Details:} allows an administrator to change the description and
membership type of a site and also to specify tags and categories for
the site. The membership type can be set as open, restricted or private
based on the privacy needs of the site. Users can join and leave an open
site at will. To join a restricted site, a user has to be added by the
site administrator. A user can also request to be added through the
Sites section of the Control Panel. A private site is like a restricted
site but doesn't appear in the Sites section of the Control Panel for
users who aren't members.

\textbf{Categorization:} allows you to apply categories and tags to the
site.

\textbf{Site URL:} Set a friendly URL and/or a virtual host for your
site here. The \emph{Friendly URL} option lets you manage the path to
your site in the portal's URL. Friendly URLs are used for both public
and private pages. For public pages, the friendly URL is appended to\hfill\break
\texttt{http://lo\-cal\-host:8080/web}. For private pages, the friendly URL is
appended to \hfill\break \texttt{http://lo\-cal\-host:8080/group}. Each friendly URL needs to be a
unique name, of course. Having a human-readable friendly URL assists
indexing bots and is critical to good search engine optimization.

For example, suppose you were creating a portal for a bank called the
Best Bank. If you set the friendly URL of your portal's default site to
/best-bank, the URL of your default site's public home page would change
to http://localhost:8080/web/best-bank/home. If your portal's default
site had private pages, the URL of the default private home page would
change to http://localhost:8080/group/best-bank/home.

Note that if you're adding a friendly URL for your portal's home page,
you should update your portal's Home URL field so that page requests to
http://localhost:8080 redirect properly. To do this, navigate to the
Portal Settings page of the Control Panel and find the Home URL field in
the Navigation section. For our bank example, we would enter
\emph{/web/best-bank/home} into the Home URL field. Once you've entered
this setting, page requests to localhost:8080 will redirect to the
friendly URL of your portal's new homepage:
http://localhost:8080/web/best-bank/home.

\emph{Virtual Hosts} make web navigation much easier for your users by
connecting a domain name to a site. This tab allows you to define a
domain name (i.e., www.mycompany.com) for your site. This can be a full
domain or a subdomain. This enables you to host a number of web sites as
separate sites on one Liferay server.

For instance, if we set this up for the Lunar Resort's development
network, users in that site could use \emph{developers.lunar-resort.com}
to get to their site, provided that the Lunar Resort portal's network
administrators created the domain name and pointed it to the Liferay
server.

To set this up, the DNS name \emph{developers.lunar-resort.com} should
point to your portal's IP address first. Then enter
\emph{http://developers.lunar-resort.com} in the Virtual Host tab for
the Developers site. This helps users quickly access their site without
having to recall an extended URL.

\textbf{Site Template:} If you've created the site from a site template,
this section displays information about the link between the site
template and the site. Specifically, you can see which site template was
used and whether or not it allows modifications to the pages inherited
from it by site administrators. If you're not using site templates for
this site, you can safely ignore this section.

\textbf{Sitemap:} lets you send a sitemap to some search engines so they
can crawl your site. It uses the sitemap protocol, which is an industry
standard. You can publish your site to Yahoo or Google and their web
crawlers will use the sitemap to index your site. Liferay Portal makes
this very simple for administrators by generating the sitemap XML for
all public web sites.

By selecting one of the search engine links, the sitemap will be sent to
them. It's only necessary to do this once per site. The search engine
crawler will periodically crawl the sitemap once you've made the initial
request.

If you're interested in seeing what is being sent to the search engines,
select the \emph{Preview} link to see the generated XML.

\textbf{Robots:} If you're using virtual hosting for this site, you can
configure \texttt{robots.txt} rules for the domain. The Robots page
gives you the option to configure your \texttt{robots.txt} for both
public and private pages on a site. If you don't have Virtual Hosting
set up, this tab is rather boring.

\textbf{Default User Associations:} lets you configure site roles and
teams that newly assigned site members will have by default. If you'd
like to learn more about creating roles and/or teams, visit the
\emph{Advanced Web Content Management} chapter.

\textbf{Staging:} enables you to edit and revise a page behind the
scenes, then publish changes to your site once they have been completed
and reviewed. For a full explanation of Staging, see chapter 3:
\emph{Advanced Web Content Management}.

\textbf{Analytics:} allows you to integrate your pages with Google
Analytics. Liferay provides seamless integration with Google Analytics,
allowing you to place your ID in one place, then it will get inserted on
every page. This enables you to focus your efforts on building the page,
rather than remembering to put the code everywhere. Google Analytics is
a free service which lets you do all kinds of traffic analysis on your
site so you can see who visits, where visitors are from and what pages
they most often visit. This helps you tweak your site so you can provide
the most relevant content to your users.

\textbf{Content Sharing:} lets you configure whether sub-sites can
display content from this site. Even if you initially allowed content
sharing between the parent site and its sub-sites, you're able to
deselect this option and immediately revoke content sharing from all
sub-sites.

\textbf{Recycle Bin:} provides the option to enable/disable the Recycle
Bin for your site. You can also regulate the age (in days) for which
content is able to be stored in the Recycle Bin until it is permanently
deleted. For a full explanation of the Recycle Bin, see the
\emph{Configuring Liferay Applications} chapter.

\textbf{Custom Fields:} lets you edit the custom fields you already have
configured for the \emph{Site} resource. If you don't have any custom
fields configured for the Site resource, you can navigate to the Control
Panel $\rightarrow$\emph{Custom Fields} located under the \emph{Configuration} tab.

\textbf{Display Settings:} lets you configure the language options for
your site. You have options to use the default language options or
define a new default language.

\textbf{Pages:} From Site Settings, click on \emph{Public Pages} or
\emph{Private Pages} to manage some basic features of the pages on a
site. If no pages have been defined yet, you can set site templates for
the public or private pages. If pages already exist, links are provided
to view them. You can also change the site's application adapter, which
is a special type of hook plugin that customizes out of the box
functionality for specific sites.

\textbf{Site Hierarchy:} New to Liferay 6.2 is the ability to organize
sites into hierarchies. At the bottom of the Site Settings page is the
\emph{Parent Site} section. This feature allows you to select the parent
site for the site you're currently on. After selecting a parent site,
you have a checkbox option to limit membership to members of the parent
site. For more information on site hierarchies, navigate to the
\emph{Leveraging Liferay's Multi-site Capabilities} section.

Now that you know how to configure sites, let's look at page templates
and site templates.

\subsubsection{Page Templates and Site
Templates}\label{page-templates-and-site-templates}

\emph{Page Templates} and \emph{Site Templates} are invaluable tools for
building similar pages on larger portals. As you continue to add pages
to sites in your portal, you'll notice repeatable patterns in the
designs of those pages. Page templates enable you to preconfigure a
single page and then apply it to any new page you create. Site templates
allow you to do the same thing but on the scale of a site--if you have
multiple sites that use a similar structure of pages, you can create a
single site template and use it to create as many sites as desired. For
more information on page templates and site templates, see the
\emph{Advanced Web Content Management} chapter.

\subsubsection{Site Content}\label{site-content}

Liferay 6.2 separates Web Content management from the Control Panel by
placing it on the \emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site Administration} page. From
Site Administration, you'll notice the Content heading where all your
portal's content can be managed, including web content.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/web-content-site-content.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.11: Your site's content resides on the Site
Administration page.}
\end{figure}

For details about Liferay's social collaboration suite, see chapter 10.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} The \emph{Web Content List} and \emph{Recent Content}
plugins were deprecated in Liferay 6.2 and are disabled by default. To
activate a disabled plugin, navigate to the Control Panel →
\emph{Plugins Configuration} and scroll through the list of portlets
until you find the plugin. Select the plugins name and click the
\emph{Active} checkbox. Then click \emph{Save}. Both plugins will be
removed in Liferay 7.0.

The Web Content List portlet will be migrated to the Asset Publisher for
7.0, and configured to only display web content with the category
matching the type.

\end{roundedframe}
Next, let's learn more details about creating pages.

\subsection{Creating Pages}\label{creating-pages}

There are a lot of other things you can do beyond placing portlets on a
page. So let's start working on the Lunar Resort site. You can do this
by going up to the Dockbar and clicking \emph{My Sites} $\rightarrow$\emph{Lunar
Resort}.

We'll use the \emph{Community} page you created earlier in the chapter.
Navigate to the \emph{Community} page and select the \emph{Add} button
from the left palette and then the \emph{Page} tab.

This screen's options should look familiar to you from previous
sections, but let's briefly go through how to create a new page:

The Page interface allows you to:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Give the name of the page
\item
  Hide the page from the theme navigation
\item
  Choose the page template
\item
  Link to another website
\item
  Link to another page in the current site
\item
  Copy an existing page
\end{itemize}

When you select \emph{Add Page} at the bottom of the menu, your new page
will appear on the navigation menu of your site. You can drag the page
names to their correct order as you see fit.

You can also create new pages from the Site Pages interface. Navigate to
Site Administration $\rightarrow$\emph{Site Pages}. If you navigate to \emph{Public
Pages} or \emph{Private Pages} on your site hierarchy, you'll notice the
\emph{Add Page} button, which we discussed earlier in the chapter. If
you navigate to a specific site, you'll notice the \emph{Add Child Page}
button.

The \emph{Add Child Page} lets you create child pages underneath the
page you've selected. You can nest pages as deep as you like but for
every page below the top level hierarchy you must provide navigation to
it via a Navigation or Breadcrumb portlet, at least with most themes
(including the default). Developers can create themes which have
cascading menu bars which show the full hierarchy. Some examples of that
are in Liferay's plugin repositories.

For now, click the back arrow. You should be able to define and manage
pages in Liferay at this point so let's look at what you'd put on a
page.

\subsubsection{Adding Portlets to a
Page}\label{adding-portlets-to-a-page}

As we discussed earlier, Liferay Portal pages are composed of portlets.
All of your site's functionality, from blogs to shopping, is composed of
portlets. Even static web content can be displayed through Web Content
Display portlets. To add a portlet to a page, just click the \emph{Add}
button from the left palette and select the \emph{Applications} tab. You
can either browse through the categories of available portlets until you
find the one you're looking for or you can search for portlets by name.
Once you've found a portlet, click the \emph{Add} button to add it the
current page. Once it's been added to the page, you can drag it to a new
position. Alternatively, you can drag the portlet directly from the
Applications menu to a specific location on the page. Let's add some
portlets to the Collaboration page of the Lunar Resort site.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-portlet-layout.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.12: Yeah, we're showoffs. But as you can see, your
page layout options are virtually limitless.}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  From the left palette, select \emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Applications}.
\item
  In the menu that appears, expand the \emph{Collaboration} category.
\item
  Drag the \emph{Blogs Aggregator} portlet off the Add Application
  window onto the right column of our page.
\item
  Next, drag the \emph{Wiki} portlet to the \emph{left column}.
\end{enumerate}

See how easy it is to add applications to your pages? We've added the
Wiki portlet and Blogs Aggregator portlet to the Community page.

It's easy to make your pages look exactly the way you want them to. If
the default layout options provided aren't enough, you can even develop
your own. To find more information about developing custom layout
templates, please refer to the Liferay Developer Network.\footnote{
\url{https://dev.liferay.com}}

\subsubsection{Page Permissions}\label{page-permissions}

By default, public pages are just that: public. They can be viewed by
anybody, logged in or not logged in. And private pages are really only
private from non-members of the site. If someone has joined your site or
is a member of your organization, that person can see all the private
pages. You can, however, modify the permissions on individual pages in
either page group so only certain users can view them.

Let's say we wanted to create a page only for administrators to see. We
can do this with the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Go to the Dockbar and select \emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site
  Administration}.
\item
  Click the \emph{Site Pages} link (if necessary).
\item
  Click the \emph{Private Pages} tab to switch to the Private Pages.
  Remember, these pages by default are viewable only by members of the
  site.
\item
  Create a page called \emph{Admin Tips}.
\item
  Click on the page in the tree on the left and then click
  \emph{Permissions}.
\item
  Uncheck the \emph{View} and \emph{Add Discussion} permissions next to
  the Site Member role.
\item
  Click the \emph{Save} button.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-page-permissions.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.13: The Permissions offer a plethora of options for
each role.}
\end{figure}

Congratulations! You've just changed the permissions for this page so
only site administrators can view it. Any users you add to this role can
now see the page. Other users, even members of this site, won't have
permission to see it.

Pages in Liferay are as flexible as pages you'd create manually without
a portal. Using a point and click interface, you can define your site
any way you want. You can create and remove pages, export and import
them, set their layouts, define how they are indexed by search engines
and more. You've also been introduced to Liferay's concept of sites.
Again, using a point and click interface, you can create multiple web
sites and define how users can access them, whether they are linked to a
domain name and create all of their pages.

You now understand how to manage pages in Liferay Portal. It's time to
move on to adding content to those pages. Liferay's Web Content
Management (WCM) is a highly powerful, yet flexible, set of tools that
enables you to successfully manage your web site.

You'll soon discover that Liferay's WCM is easy to learn and highly
configurable. If you already have experience with WCM, you'll see some
new features and improvements to old ones. If you're new to Liferay's
WCM, then you'll be surprised at how fast you will be adding, editing
and scheduling content on your site. Once you're familiar with portlets
such as Web Content Display and Asset Publisher, your ability to manage
an immense site with a large amount of content will simply amaze you.

We'll be using Liferay's WCM to publish simple pieces of content,
develop templates to define how content is to be displayed, set up a
workflow for content to be approved, schedule when content is to be
published and much, much more.

\section{Features of Liferay's WCM}\label{features-of-liferays-wcm}

Liferay's WCM offers a host of features that makes managing the content
of your site easier:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{WYSIWYG Editor:} A complete HTML editor that allow you to
  modify fonts, add color, insert images and much more.
\item
  \textbf{Structure Editor:} Easily add and remove fields you want
  available to content creators and then dynamically move them around.
  This editor includes an entire suite of form controls you can drag and
  drop onto your structure.
\item
  \textbf{Template Editor:} Import template script files that inform the
  system how to display the content within the fields determined by the
  structure.
\item
  \textbf{Web Content Display:} A portlet that allows you place web
  content on a page in your portal.
\item
  \textbf{Asset Publisher:} A portlet which can aggregate different
  types of content together in one view.
\item
  \textbf{Scheduler:} Lets you schedule when content is reviewed,
  displayed and removed.
\item
  \textbf{Workflow Integration:} Run your content through an approval or
  review process.
\item
  \textbf{Staging:} Use a separate staging server or stage your content
  locally so you can keep your changes separate from the live site.
\end{itemize}

Liferay's Web Content Management is a powerful and robust tool for
creating and organizing content on your web site. Let's begin by
examining some basic concepts involving sites and pages.

As you'll see, Liferay's WCM is a full-featured solution for managing
your web site. We'll start with an overview of what it has to offer and
then we'll dive down into its features. Note that web content is just
one kind of asset on Liferay. Other types of content (blog posts, wiki
articles, message board posts, etc.) are also considered assets. Liferay
provides a general framework for handling assets that includes tags,
categories, comments, ratings, and more. Please see chapter 5 for more
information on Liferay's asset framework.

\subsection{Creating (Basic) Content}\label{creating-basic-content}

As we've already discussed, content is the reason web sites exist.
Liferay Portal has made it easier than ever to get content published to
your site. Because Liferay Portal is so flexible, you can use basic
authoring tools right away or take advantage of the more advanced
features. It's adaptable to your needs.

We'll begin by creating some simple content using Liferay's WYSIWYG
editor. Then we'll publish it to the home page of the Lunar Resort's web
site. This is a fast and straightforward process that demonstrates how
easy it is to create and publish content on your Liferay Portal
instance. Let's learn about the Web Content section in Site
Administration so we can create and publish our first pieces of content.

When you manage web content from the Site Administration page, you can
select the location where the content resides. For instance, you can add
content that's available to a specific site or globally across the
portal. If you're on the site you wish to add content to, simply
navigate to the \emph{Admin} tab on the Dockbar and select \emph{Site
Administration}. Conversely, if you need to switch sites or would like
to add content globally, navigate to the Control Panel and select
\emph{Sites}. From this window, you can change the scope of where you'd
like to view, edit, or create content.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sites-selector.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.14: You can choose where to create content by
navigating to the Control Panel and selecting \emph{Sites}.}
\end{figure}

Once you have the Lunar Resort site selected, click on the \emph{Web
Content} link in Site Administration. You'll see a folder structure
containing all of the web content articles that exist in the currently
selected scope (the Lunar Resort site). You can click \emph{Add} →
\emph{Folder} to create a new folder. For sites with lots of content and
web content articles, it can be very useful to use folders to group
certain kinds of web content articles together. Click \emph{Add} →
\emph{Basic Web Content} to create a new web content article.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/web-content-add-menu.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.15: Click \emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Basic Web Content} to
create a new simple web content article. To create a new web content
article based on an existing web content structure, click \emph{Add} and
then click on the name of the structure you'd like to use.}
\end{figure}

Existing web content structures also appear in the \emph{Add} menu. This
provides users with shortcuts for creating specific kinds of web content
articles. For example, if a web content structure called \emph{FAQ} has
been created for Frequently Asked Questions articles in your currently
selected scope, you can create a new FAQ article by clicking \emph{Add}
$\rightarrow$\emph{FAQ}.

Click \emph{Manage} $\rightarrow$\emph{Structures} to view a list of web content
structures that have already been created in your chosen scope. You can
add new web content structures here. Web Content templates are always
associated with a particular web content structure, so you can click
\emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Manage Templates} to view the web content
templates associated with a structure or add a new template to a
structure. In the next chapter, we'll cover advanced features such as
structures, templates, and content scheduling in detail.

\subsubsection{Rich, WYSIWYG Editing}\label{rich-wysiwyg-editing}

Once you've clicked \emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Basic Web Content}, you'll find a
highly customizable form that by default has two fields: a title and a
powerful WYSIWYG editor. We could customize this form to contain
whatever fields our content needs but we'll keep things simple for now.
If web content structures have already been created in your currently
selected scope, you can select one for your new web content article by
clicking \emph{Select} next to the \emph{Structure} heading. We discuss
web content structures and templates in detail in the next chapter.

Type the words \emph{Welcome to the Lunar Resort} in the \emph{Name}
field. Notice that content can be localized in whatever language you
want. If you click on the \emph{localize} checkbox, two select boxes
appear which allow you to pick the language you're working in and the
default language. You can enter translations of your content for any
language in the list. The figure below shows this interface but for now,
we won't be using it, so you can leave it unchecked. In the content
field, add a short sentence announcing the web site is up and running.

Getting a new web site up and running is an exciting step for anyone,
whether it is a large corporation or a small non-profit charity. To
celebrate this momentous achievement at the Lunar Resort, let's give our
announcement some of the pomp and circumstance we think it deserves!

Using the editor, select all the text and then change the style to
\emph{Heading 1} and the color to \emph{Navy}. You could insert an image
here or even more text with a different style, as demonstrated in the
screenshot below. You can also add bullets, numbering, links to another
site or custom images. You can even add an emoticon. Go ahead and add a
smiley face to the end of your announcement.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-example2.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.16: View your content changes directly in the editor.}
\end{figure}

The WYSIWYG editor is a flexible tool that gives you the ability to add
text, images, tables, links and more. Additionally, you can modify the
display to match the purpose of the content. Plus it's integrated with
the rest of Liferay Portal: for example, when you upload an image to be
added to a page, that image can be viewed and manipulated in the
Documents and Media portlet.

If you're HTML savvy, Liferay WCM doesn't leave you out in the cold. You
can switch from the WYSIWYG view by clicking the \emph{Source} button.
From the Source view, you can view the HTML content of your web content.
If you wish, can edit the HTML directly.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/web-content-video.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.17: If you've installed and enabled Xuggler from the
\emph{Server Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{External Tools} section of the
Control Panel, you can add audio and video to your web content!}
\end{figure}

You can integrate Liferay with external services to enable additional
functionality. For example, if you navigate to the Control Panel, click
on \emph{Server Administration} and then on \emph{External Services},
you can install and enable Xuggler. Enabling Xuggler allows you to embed
audio and video files in web content. Installing and enabling Xuggler is
easy; you can do it right from the Control Panel. Please refer to
chapter 17 of this guide for more details.

Once Xuggler has been installed and enabled, embedding audio or video
files in a web content is easy. From the Dockbar, navigate to \emph{Site
Content} $\rightarrow$\emph{Web Content} and click \emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Basic Web
Content}. Look for the buttons on the CKEditor toolbar with audio and
video icons. Click on either the audio or video button and then click
\emph{Browse Server} to browse to the audio or video file's location on
your portal's documents and media repository. When you find the
appropriate file, click \emph{Choose}. If you haven't already uploaded
the audio or video file to the portal, you can do so by clicking on the
\emph{Upload} button. Select the file and then check that the audio or
video component appears in the web content. Excellent! When your web
content is published, users can view or listen the embedded multimedia!

The right side of the New Web Content form provides options for
customizing your web content.

\textbf{Abstract:} lets you to create a brief summary of the web
content. You can also pair the text with a small image.

\textbf{Categorization:} specifies the content type from a list of
options. They are \emph{Announcements}, \emph{Blogs}, \emph{General},
\emph{News}, \emph{Press Release}, and \emph{Test}. You can also create
tags to make the content easier to find in a search. Note that these
categories are defined by a property in the properties file; see the
\texttt{journal.article.types} property in chapter 20 for further
information.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} The Web Content Type portlet, located within the
Categorization menu, is deprecated for Liferay 6.2 and will be removed
in Liferay 7.0. The portlet will be migrated to a vocabulary with
categories.
\vspace{14pt}

\end{roundedframe}

\textbf{Schedule:} customizes the date and time your content publishes
and/or expires.

\textbf{Display Page:} lets you determine where the web contents are
displayed when linked from other pages. The Canonical URL can be used
here. The Canonical URL is unique for articles that redirect the visitor
to the article's default display page.

Imagine you have a newspaper with a sports section and a technology
section. You add a Sports page and a Tech page to your site, each one
with a specific banner and look and feel. You want the articles to
appear in the appropriate pages, but you know in Liferay articles are
not related to pages. You can add an article as often as you like in
different web content display portlets or in configured Asset
Publishers. But if you have a \emph{View in context} link, where will
you show your article? This is where you'd use a default display page.
Articles that have a default display page defined are shown with other
related articles in the same display page.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/wcm-menu.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.18: New web content can be customized in various ways
using the menu on the right.}
\end{figure}

Imagine you have 100 sports articles and 100 tech articles. In previous
versions of Liferay you'd need to create a page for each article to show
it. Now with only one sports page and one tech page, you can show all
articles in one place in a consistent fashion.

\subsubsection{Creating a Display Page}\label{creating-a-display-page}

There are two ways of creating a display page. You can use a
\emph{Content Display Page} template, which automatically creates
everything you need, or you can create one manually. The Content Display
Page template is found under \emph{Page Templates} in the Sites section
of the Control Panel.

To create a display page manually, add an Asset Publisher to a page.
Then make it the Default Asset Publisher for the page. This defines this
Asset Publisher as the one that displays the content if several Asset
Publishers are on the same page. Set this up by clicking
\emph{Configuration} on your Asset Publisher. Under the \emph{Setup}
tab, navigate to \emph{Display Settings} and check the checkbox labeled
\emph{Set as the Default Asset Publisher for This Page}.

Once you've given an article its default display page, links to the
article redirect the user to its default display page. To see how this
works, add an Asset Publisher to another page, like the Home page of the
newspaper, and configure it to \emph{View in a Specific Portlet}. This
setting is found in the \emph{Asset Link Behavior} menu under Display
Settings. If you click on the link, you'll be redirected to the Default
Display Page of the article.

You now see that the link looks something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
www.lunar-resort.com/lunar-article
\end{verbatim}

This is an example of a canonical URL, and it's a nice enhancement for
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) because the article's URL becomes the
page URL. To a search engine that's crawling your site, this means that
the location of your article never changes. And if you decide to use the
content on another page in the future, the article is still available at
this URL. This feature is used in search results, in related assets and
in Asset Publishers. For more information on Liferay's Display Pages,
see chapter 5.

\textbf{Related Assets:} enables you to connect any number of assets
within a site or across the portal, even if they don't share any tags
and aren't in the same category. You can connect your content to a Blogs
Entry, Message Boards Message, Web Content, Calendar Event, Bookmarks
Entry, Documents and Media Document, and a Wiki Page.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/related-assets-link.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.19: This blog entry has links to three Related Assets:
one web content and two message board entries.}
\end{figure}

You'll learn how to publish links to related assets using the Related
Assets portlet in the \emph{Defining content relationships} section of
chapter 5.

\textbf{Permissions:} customize who has access to the content. By
default, content is viewable by Anyone (Guest Role). You can limit
viewable permissions by selecting any Role from the drop-down or in the
list. Additionally, Liferay Portal provides the ability to customize
permissions in more detail. Select the \emph{More Options} link next to
the drop down button and you'll find the different activities you can
grant or deny to your web content.

\textbf{Custom fields:} customize metadata about the web content. The
fields can represent anything you like, such as the web content's author
or creation date. If custom fields have been defined for web content
(which can be done from the \emph{Custom Fields} page of the Control
Panel), they appear here.

For more information on Custom Fields see the Custom Fields section in
chapter 16.

For this piece of web content, we don't need to change anything. After
you're finished with permissions, click \emph{Save as Draft}. This saves
the content in draft form. Once you're satisfied with your changes,
select \emph{Publish}. This makes the content available for display, but
we still have some work to do to enable users to see it. In Liferay WCM,
all content resides in a container, which is one of two portlets: Web
Content Display or Web Content List. By far the most frequently used is
the \emph{Web Content Display} portlet. Let's look at how it works.

\subsection{Publishing (Basic) Content}\label{publishing-basic-content}

Now that we've created and published our first piece of web content for
the Lunar Resort, it's time to display it. First, add the \emph{Web
Content Display} portlet to our Welcome page by selecting the \emph{Add}
button from the left palette and selecting the \emph{Applications} tab.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/add-web-content-display.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.20: Adding the Web Content Display Portlet}
\end{figure}

Once the portlet appears, drag it to the position on the page where you
want your content to appear. You can have as many Web Content Display
portlets on a page as you need, which gives you the power to lay out
your content exactly the way you want it.

To add existing web content, click the \emph{Select Web Content} button
on the lower left of the portlet. You will see the message \emph{Please
select a web content from the list below}. You have several options
here.

Naturally, if your content appears in the list, you can simply select
it. If there is lots of published content available, you could search
for the content by name, ID, type, version, content and site (click the
\emph{Advanced} gear to see all the options). You can also show the
available locales for your content. If you're working on the page for a
particular language, you can select the translation of your content that
goes with your locale.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-choosing-web-content.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.21: Publishing web content is a snap. At a minimum,
you only have to select the content you wish to publish. You can also
enable lots of optional features to let your users interact with your
content.}
\end{figure}

If you have enabled OpenOffice.org integration with your portal, you can
also enable document conversion for your content. This gives your users
the ability to download your content in their format of choice. This is
especially handy if you are running a research or academically oriented
site; users can very quickly download PDFs of your content for their
research projects.

Note that you also have other options, such as enabling a Print button,
enabling ratings so users can rate the content, enabling comments and
enabling ratings on comments.

The Print button pops the content up in a separate browser window that
contains just the content, without any of the web site navigation. This
is handy for printing the content. Enabling ratings shows one of two
ratings interfaces Liferay has: five stars or thumbs up and thumbs down.
This can be set globally in the \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. See
chapter 12 for further information about this.

Enabling comments creates a discussion forum attached to your content
which users can use to discuss your content. Enabling ratings on
comments gives your users the ability to rate the comments. You may
decide you want one, some or none of these features, which is why
they're all implemented as simple check boxes to be enabled or disabled
at need.

If you click the \emph{Supported Clients} tab, you'll see you can choose
the type of client to which you want to expose content. This lets you
target the large screens of users' computers for expansive graphics and
lots of special effects or target the small screens of mobile devices
with pertinent information and a lightweight page. For now, leave both
checked and click the \emph{Save} button. You can now close the
configuration window.

To publish new content, select the \emph{Add} button on the lower left
of the portlet. This launches the same full-featured editor you've
already seen in the Control Panel, which lets you add and edit content
in place as you are working on your page.

This is another example of the flexibility that Liferay Portal offers.
At times, you may want to add content directly into the Web Content
Display portlet of the page you're managing, especially if you are in
the process of building the page. At other times, you may want to
navigate to Site Administration to create content, because at that
moment you're more concerned with the creation of the content and not
where the content will later be displayed. Liferay WCM supports both
processes.

Editing content that's already been published is just as easy as
creating new content is. You'll use the same exact tools.

\subsection{Editing Content}\label{editing-content}

Once the content is displayed--whether you've selected content or
created it in the Web Content Display portlet--you can edit the content
directly from the Web Content Display portlet or from the Control Panel.
To edit it from the Web Content Display portlet, select the \emph{Edit}
button to the lower left of the portlet. This launches the WYSIWYG
editor and from there you can make any necessary changes.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/web-content-display-icons.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.22: The \emph{Edit}, \emph{Select Web Content}, and
\emph{Add} buttons appear when hovering over their icons.}
\end{figure}

When you publish updates to a web content that's already being displayed
somewhere on your portal (e.g., in a Web Content Display portlet or an
Asset Publisher portlet), the content is immediately updated (unless, of
course, you have a workflow enabled, which we'll discuss below). It
makes no difference whether you edit it from a Web Content Display
portlet, from the Asset Publisher, or from the Site Administration
interface.

Note: if you want to view your page the way your users will see it
(i.e., without all those portlet controls and icons), go up to the left
palette and select the \emph{Edit Controls} icon. This makes all those
extra controls you see as a portal administrator disappear. You'll also
notice the green ``eye'' transforms into an orange ``eye''. If you need
to use those controls again, just select \emph{Edit Controls} to return
to the original format.

That's pretty much all there is to simple content creation. Whole sites
have been created this way. But if you want to take advantage of the
full power of Liferay's WCM, you'll want to use structures and templates
found in chapter 3. Next, let's see how you can manage your content with
an approval process called workflow.

\section{Using Liferay's Workflow with
WCM}\label{using-liferays-workflow-with-wcm}

Workflow is essentially a predetermined sequence of connected steps. In
Liferay WCM, workflow is designed to manage the creation, modification
and publication of web content. You can set up a workflow so content
can't be published without going through an approval process you design.
In this way, content is published to the site only after it has been
reviewed and approved.

Liferay's workflow engine is called Kaleo workflow and it ships with
Liferay CE. If you have uninstalled it or are using EE, it needs to be
installed and configured separately. This is covered in chapter 6. Since
we have somewhat of a ``What came first--the chicken or the egg?''
problem, for now, we'll assume it's installed and look at how you can
take advantage of workflow in getting your content through any approval
steps between creation and publication.

You may have noticed something appears to be missing from the staging
process discussed above. In particular, you might be asking the
question, ``How do I reject changes?'' Staging is integrated with
Liferay's Workflow engine. To have a review process for staged pages,
you need to make sure you have a workflow engine configured and you have
staging set up in the workflow. To do this, select the workflow
definition desired for page revisions in the Workflow Configuration.

When using a workflow, clicking \emph{Submit for Publication} submits
the staged pages into the workflow. Once all necessary approvals have
been completed, the page status is marked as ready for publication. The
\emph{Publish to Live Now} and \emph{Schedule for Publication} options
publish the last version of the selected pages marked as ready for
publication.

To enable workflow for Web Content, navigate to the Control Panel and
select \emph{Workflow Configuration}. From there, select a workflow that
has been deployed to Liferay.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-workflow-config.png}
\caption{\\Figure 2.23: You can select the pre-made \emph{Single Approver}
workflow to experiment with workflow management.}
\end{figure}

As you'll discover in chapter 10, you can design workflows to suit your
organization's approval process. For the Lunar Resort's implementation
we'll use the \emph{Single Approver} workflow which ships with the
product.

\subsection{Defining Workflows for Web
Content}\label{defining-workflows-for-web-content}

Let's set up Liferay's Workflow for the Lunar Resort web site. You must
have the Kaleo workflow plugin installed in order for the workflow
categories to appear in the Control Panel. Liferay's Kaleo workflow
engine ships with CE versions of Liferay. For installation instructions
for Liferay EE, please see chapter 10.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Go to the Site Administration page and select \emph{Workflow
  Configuration} from the \emph{Configuration} section.
\item
  From the select box, choose \emph{Single Approver} for Web Content.
  Click \emph{Save}. Note that you can add workflow to many of Liferay's
  portlets.
\end{enumerate}

That's all it takes to set up workflow for web content. Now that
workflow is enabled, publishing content works a little bit differently.
Let's go through the process of publishing details for new class
offerings at the Lunar Resort. Return to the home page and click the
\emph{Add Web Content} icon on the Web Content Display portlet. Call the
new content \emph{Course Offerings} and enter some content. Notice that
the Publish button is now gone. In its place is a \emph{Submit for
Publication} button. Go ahead and click it.

Next, go to the \emph{Workflow Tasks} in Site Administration and select
\emph{My Workflow Tasks}. You will see the option to Review Content for
Sales Goals. It shows because you are logged in as an Administrator.
There is also a Content Approvers role which is defined by this workflow
and anyone in this role can approve content as well.

To approve the content, you must first take ownership of it. Click on
the task. You should see the screen below.

Taking ownership of, reviewing and approving content is very easy:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Click the \emph{Assign to Me} button. Alternatively, you could assign
  it to someone else in the Content Approvers role or create / update a
  due date for the content's approval.
\item
  Once you've assigned it to yourself, buttons allowing you to approve
  or reject the content appear. Click \emph{Approve}.
\item
  You're asked to submit a comment. You'd have to do this for either
  \emph{Approve} or \emph{Reject}. Add a comment and click \emph{Save}.
\item
  The content is now approved.
\end{enumerate}

In a real world situation, you obviously wouldn't want the person who
created the content to be the one who approves it. Instead, you would
have one or more roles designed for users who will be creating content
and you would have specific users assigned to one or more roles for
approving content. Our example was of a very straightforward workflow,
as it has only a single approver. Kaleo workflow allows you to design
workflows that go through as many steps as you need to conform to your
business processes. We look at Kaleo workflow in more detail in chapter
6.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-1}

This chapter has provided an introduction to Liferay site management and
web content management. We've learned how you can use Liferay to create
multiple sites with different membership types. We've seen how easy it
is to create and manage sites and to create and manage pages within a
site in Liferay. We've also seen how easy it is to create and edit web
content using Liferay's rich WYSIWYG editor. This powerful tool enables
users who don't have much experience with HTML and CSS to easily create
and style web content of any type that you'd like to publish on the web.

Liferay WCM also includes a powerful workflow engine, allowing you to
set up custom publishing rules to fit your organization. You can set up
custom approval processes for different sites as well as for different
kinds of content within a site. We'll examine sites in more detail in
chapter 3. We'll also cover some more advanced web content management
tools such as web content structures and templates, page templates and
site templates, staging, and mobile device rules.

\chapter{Advanced Web Content
Management}\label{advanced-web-content-management}

In the previous chapter you learned some basic ways you can use Liferay
to handle your web content. In this chapter you'll delve deeper into
slightly more complex web content management techniques. But don't be
alarmed, it's not too intense. We'll cover the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Web content structures and templates
\item
  RSS Feeds
\item
  Site templates and page templates
\item
  Localization
\item
  Allowing users to customize site pages
\item
  Scheduling Web Content
\item
  Staging
\item
  Creating teams to allow for flexible management of site permissions
\item
  Mobile device rules
\item
  Monitoring with Google Analytics
\end{itemize}

You'll examine how web content structures and templates provide
additional power and flexibility to the web content management system
you saw previously. You'll also learn how easy it is to set up and
administer multiple sites in Liferay. Next, we'll learn how you can
empower your users to create personal customizations of site pages.
You'll also examine how you can use staging to manage the publication of
pages and content on your site. You'll conclude with sections on
creating teams and rules for presenting site pages to mobile devices.

\section{Advanced Content with Structures and
Templates}\label{advanced-content-with-structures-and-templates}

If you've ever launched a web site, you know that as it grows, you can
experience growing pains. This is the case especially if you've given
lots of people access to the site to make whatever changes they need to
make. Without preset limitations, users can display content in any order
and in any manner they desire (think huge, flashing letters in a font
nobody can read). Content can get stale, especially if those responsible
for it don't maintain it like they should. And sometimes, content is
published that should never have seen the light of day.

Thankfully, Liferay WCM helps you handle all of those situations. You
can use \emph{Structures} to define which fields are available to users
when they create content. These can be coupled with \emph{Templates}
that define how to display that content. Content won't get stale,
because you can take advantage of the \emph{Scheduling} feature to
determine when content is displayed and when it's removed. Additionally,
you can configure Liferay's built-in \emph{Workflow} system to set up a
review and publishing process so only what you want winds up on the live
site. Liferay Portal gives you the management tools you need to run
everything from a simple, one-page web site to an enormous, content-rich
site.

All of this starts with structures.

\subsection{Using Structures}\label{using-structures}

Structures are the foundation for web content. They determine which
fields are available to users as they create new items for display.
Structures not only improve manageability for the administrator, they
also make it much easier for users to quickly add content.

For example, say you're managing an online news magazine. All your
articles need to contain the same types of information: a title, a
subtitle, an author and one or more pages of text and images that
comprise the body of the article. If Liferay only supported simple
content as has been described above, you'd have no way to make sure your
users entered a title, subtitle, and author. You might also get articles
that don't match the look and feel of your site. If titles are supposed
to be navy blue but they come in from your writers manually set to light
blue, you need to spend time reformatting them before they are
published.

Structures give you the ability to provide a format for your content so
your users know what needs to be entered to have a complete article.
Using structures, you can provide a form for your users which spells out
exactly what is required and can be formatted automatically using a
template.

You create a structure by adding form controls such as text fields, text
boxes, text areas (HTML), check boxes, select boxes and multi-selection
lists. Also you can add specialized, Liferay-specific application fields
such as an Image Uploader and Documents and Media right onto the
structure. Furthermore, you can move the elements around by dragging
them where you want them. This makes it easy for you to prototype
different orders for your input fields. Additionally, elements can be
grouped together into blocks which can then be repeatable. Template
writers can then write a template which loops through these blocks and
presents your content in innovative ways, such as in sliding navigation
bars, content which scrolls with the user and more.

Let's look at how we can create and edit structures through the Manage
Structures interface.

\subsubsection{Editing Structures}\label{editing-structures}

Go back to the Site Administration page and select \emph{Web Content}
from the Content section. The first way to access the Manage Structures
interface is simply by clicking \emph{Manage} $\rightarrow$\emph{Structures}. This
opens a popup showing all the web content structures that exist in your
currently selected scope. Here, you can add new web content structures,
edit existing ones, manage the templates associated with a structure,
edit the permissions of a structure, and copy or delete structures.

Copying web content structures can be useful if you'd like to create a
new web content structure that's similar to an existing one, but you
don't want to start from scratch. Liferay generates a unique portal ID
for the copied structure, but every other attribute of the copied
structure, including the name, is the same as that of the original. Once
you've copied a web content structure, you should enter a new name for
it to avoid confusing it with the original. When you copy a web content
structure, you'll be prompted to choose whether to copy any detail
templates or list templates associated with the structure. For
information on detail templates and list templates, please refer to
chapter 10 on
\href{https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/using-web-forms-and-dynamic-data-lists-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-10-en}{Using
Web Forms and Dynamic Data Lists}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/manage-structures.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.1: You can access the Manage Structures interface by
clicking \emph{Manage} $\rightarrow$\emph{Structures} from the Web Content page.}
\end{figure}

The second way to access the Manage Structures interface is directly
from the web content article WYSIWYG editor. Click \emph{Add} →
\emph{Basic Web Content} from the Web Content page to add another piece
of content to your portal. Instead of going right for the content, this
time we'll first create a structure. To access the Manage Structures
interface, simply click on \emph{Select} next to the \emph{Structure}
heading near the top of the page. To create a new structure in your
chosen scope, simply click on the \emph{Add} button in the Manage
Structures popup.

It's very easy to create and edit structures: all you have to do is drag
elements into the structure and then give them names. For instance,
select the \emph{Text} element and drag it onto the structure. You can
do the same with any of the elements. To remove it from the structure,
simply select the \emph{Delete} icon (trash can) in the upper right
corner of the element. You also have the ability to duplicate the
element, which can be done by selecting the \emph{Duplicate} (addition
sign) button. We'll explain the \emph{Configuration} button later.

Web content structures also have the capability of inheriting
characteristics from other structures. When a parent structure is
configured, the child structure inherits the parent's fields and
settings. Using this feature is helpful when you want to make a similar
structure to one that already exists. For example, if you'd like to
create an in-depth Lunar Resort sports article in addition to a regular
Lunar Resort sports article, you can simply inherit the characteristics
of the regular article and only add additional fields to the more
in-depth article. When the in-depth article is configured, it will
display its parent's fields in addition to its own fields.

For Liferay 6.2, the WebDAV URL feature was introduced for web content
structures and templates so users could upload and organize resources
from both a web interface and the file explorer of their desktop
operating system. With the WebDAV URL, site administrators are capable
of adding, browsing, editing, and deleting structures and templates on a
remote server. After you complete your structure, you can access the
WebDAV URL by re-opening the structure or template and clicking the
\emph{Details} section. If you'd like the see WebDAV in action, visit
the \emph{Document Management} chapter's \emph{WebDAV access} chapter.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} Some operating systems require a WebDAV server to be
class level 2 (i.e., to support file locking) before allowing
files to be read or written. For Liferay 6.2, the Documents and Media
library was upgraded to class level 2 but Web Content structures and
templates were not. This means that Liferay 6.2's Document and Media
library supports WebDAV file locking but Web Content structures and
templates do not. However, on operating systems which require WebDAV
servers to be class level 2, it's possible to avoid the restriction by
using third-party WebDAV clients (e.g.,
\href{http://cyberduck.ch}{Cyberduck}.

\end{roundedframe}
Another method to edit your structure is switching to \emph{Source} mode
and manually customizing your structure by editing its XML file. You'll
notice by default the \emph{View} mode is selected. Click the
\emph{Source} tab to switch to Source mode. This method is for the more
experienced developers.

Take a moment to add, delete, and rearrange different elements.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-structure-editor.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.2: The structure editor gives you many options to
customize your Web Content.}
\end{figure}

Liferay supports the following fields in structures:

\textbf{Boolean:} Adds a checkbox onto your structure, which stores
either \texttt{true} (checked) or \texttt{false} (unchecked). Template
developers can use this as a display rule.

\textbf{Date:} Adds a preformatted text field that displays a convenient
date picker to assist in selecting the desired data. The format for the
date is governed by the current locale.

\textbf{Decimal:} Similar to \emph{Number}, except that it required a
decimal point (.) be present.

\textbf{Documents and Media:} Adds an existing uploaded document to
attach to the structure. Also has the ability to upload documents into
the Document Library.

\textbf{HTML:} An area that uses a WYSIWYG editor to enhance the
content.

\textbf{Image:} Adds the browse image application into your structure.

\textbf{Integer:} Similar to \emph{Number}, except that it constrains
user input to non-fractional numbers.

\textbf{Link to Page:} Inserts a link to another page in the same site.

\textbf{Number:} Presents a text box that only accepts numbers as
inputs, but puts no constraints on the kind of number entered.

\textbf{Radio:} Presents the user with a list of options to choose from
using radio button inputs.

\textbf{Select:} Presents a selection of options for the user to choose
from using a combo box. Can be configured to allow multiple selections,
unlike \emph{Radio}.

\textbf{Text:} Used for items such as titles and headings.

\textbf{Text Box:} Used for the body of your content or long
descriptions.

These fields provide all you need to model any information type you
would want to use as web content. Liferay customers have used structures
to model everything from articles, to video metadata, to databases of
wildlife. You're limited only by your imagination. To fire that
imagination, let's look more closely at field settings.

\subsubsection{Editing Field Settings}\label{editing-field-settings}

When creating a new structure, it is essential that you set variable
names. Template writers can use these variables to refer to elements on
your form. If you don't set variable names, Liferay generates random
variable names and these can be difficult for a template writer to
follow. For example, consider a field called \emph{Author}. You might
create this field in your form but the underlying variable name in the
structure might look something like \texttt{TextField4882}. The template
writer needs to create markup for your structure and place the Author
field in a certain spot in the markup. How will he or she know which
field is Author when they're all named randomly?

To solve this problem, all you need to do is set a variable name for
each field as you add it to your structure. Let's do this now. In your
structure, add an element \emph{HTML}. To change its field label and
variable name, you'll need to access the field's settings. Hover over
the field and select the wrench icon that appears in the upper right
corner. Change the \emph{Field Label} value to \emph{Instructions} and
the \emph{Name} value (variable name) to \texttt{Steps}. Now your
template writer has a variable by which he or she can refer to this
field.

Here's a list of all the configurable settings available for a
structure's fields:

\textbf{Type:} Lists the type of field placed in the definition. This is
not editable but is available to reference from a template.

\textbf{Field Label:} Sets the text that can be displayed with the
field. This is the human-readable text that the user sees.

\textbf{Show Label:} Select \emph{Yes} to display the Field Label.

\textbf{Required:} Select \emph{Yes} to mark the field required. If a
field is required, users must enter a value for it in order to submit
content using this structure.

\textbf{Name:} The name of the field internally, automatically
generated. Since this is the variable name that you can read the data
from in a template, you should give a more memorable name here.

\textbf{Predefined Value:} Specifying predefined values for structure
forms is a way to specify defaults. When a user creates a new web
content article based on a structure that has predefined values for
various fields, the predefined values appear in the form as defaults for
those fields.

\textbf{Tip:} Each field can have a small help icon, with a tooltip
attached that displays helpful information. If you would like to provide
text for the tooltip you may enter it here.

\textbf{Indexable:} Select \emph{Yes} to enable Liferay to index your
field for search.

\textbf{Repeatable:} Select \emph{Yes} to make your field repeatable.
Your users can then add as many copies of this field as they like. For
example, if you're creating a structure for articles, you might want a
repeatable Author field in case you have multiple authors for a
particular article.

\textbf{Width:} Changes the width of the field. The field width can be
\emph{small}, \emph{medium}, or \emph{large} (not available for Boolean,
Documents and Media, Image, Radio, and Select.

\textbf{Multiple:} Select \emph{Yes} to enable a multi-selection list
(only available for Select).

\textbf{Options:} Changes the options available for selection. You're
able to add and remove options as well as edit each individual option's
display name and value (only available for Radio and Select).

For the Lunar Resort structure, type something in the \emph{Tip} field
that helps users know what to put into the Body element (example:
\emph{This is an HTML text area for the body of your content}). Now,
when users hover over the Help icon near your title, your tip is
displayed.

\paragraph{Structure Default Values}\label{structure-default-values}

Structure Default Values allow you to create one structure that uses
common data from multiple articles.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/structure-actions.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.3: You can edit default values via the \emph{Actions}
button of the Manage Structures interface.}
\end{figure}

Returning to our newspaper scenario again, let's say you want all sports
articles to have the same display page (sports page), the same
categories, or the same set of tags. Instead of adding them for each
article or wondering if your users are adding them to every web content,
you can add these characteristics once for every sports article by
creating default values for the structure. Creating default values is
not part of creating a new structure, so make sure you have an existing
structure.

To edit a structure's default values, go to \emph{Web Content} in the
Content section of the Site Administration page and click \emph{Manage}
$\rightarrow$\emph{Structures} to see the structures list. Find the \emph{Actions}
button for the desired structure and select \emph{Edit Default Values}
from the menu to view a window like the one below. This form allows you
to manage the structure settings.

Every new web content you create with this structure is preloaded with
the data you inserted. Next, let's demonstrate assigning permissions.

\subsubsection{Assigning Permissions}\label{assigning-permissions}

Setting permissions on structures is done using the same procedure as
permissions everywhere else in Liferay. Most users should not have the
ability to edit structures. Structures are coupled with templates, which
require some web development knowledge to create. This is why only
trusted developers should be able to create structures and templates.
Users, of course, should be able to view structures. The \emph{View}
permission enables them to make use of the structures to create content.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-structure-permissions.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.4: You're able to assign structure permissions via the
\emph{Actions} button.}
\end{figure}

You can grant or deny permissions based on Roles and this is the
recommended way to handle permissions for structures.

Now that you understand what structures are used for, you need to
understand the other half of Liferay's web content management system:
templates.

\subsection{Using Templates}\label{using-templates}

Developers create templates to display the elements of the structure in
the markup they want. Content can then be styled properly using CSS,
because markup is generated consistently by the template when structured
content is displayed. In essence, templates are scripts that tell
Liferay how to display content in the structure. Any changes to the
structure require corresponding changes to the template, because new or
deleted fields produce errors on the page. If users enter content into a
structure, it \emph{must} have a matching template. However, you have
options for whether you want your template to be permanently linked to
your structure. Generic templates are templates that are not tied to a
structure, which allows for reusable code that can be imported into
other templates. Without a template, the portal has no idea how to
display content which has been created using a custom structure.

Let's look more closely at the types of templates Liferay supports.

\subsubsection{Template Types (FTL, VM, and
XSL)}\label{template-types-ftl-vm-and-xsl}

Liferay supports templates written in three different templating
languages, to support the skill sets of the largest number of
developers. This increases the chances you can jump right in and use
whichever one you've already used before. If you haven't yet been
exposed to any of them, your best bet is FreeMarker or Velocity, as they
are less ``chatty'' than XSL and extremely simple to understand.

\textbf{FTL} (FreeMarker Template Language): Freemarker is a templating
language which could be considered a successor to Velocity. It has some
advantages over Velocity for which it sacrifices some simplicity, yet it
is still easy to use. If you haven't used any of the template languages
before, we recommend using FreeMarker: you'll get up to speed the
fastest.

\textbf{VM} (Velocity Macro): Velocity is a scripting language that lets
you mix logic with HTML. This is similar to other scripting languages,
such as PHP, though Velocity is much simpler.

\textbf{XSL} (Extensible Style Sheet Language): XSL is used in Liferay
templates to transform the underlying XML of a structure into markup
suitable for the browser. While it may not be as clean and compact as
Velocity or FTL, it's widely used for transforming XML into other
formats and it's very likely your developers have already been exposed
to it.

\subsubsection{Adding Templates}\label{adding-templates}

Liferay WCM makes it easy to create structures, templates, and content
from the same interface. Let's go through the entire flow of how you'd
create a structure, link it to a template and then create content using
them both. We'll use FreeMarker for our template and we'll lay out the
structure fields systematically to go along with the format we've
defined for our content.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Go back to the Web Content section of the Site Administration page and
  click \emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Basic Web Content}.
\item
  Click \emph{Select} next to the Structures heading to access the
  Manage Structures interface.
\item
  Click on the \emph{Add} button.
\item
  Name the structure \emph{News Article} and add the following fields:

  \begin{longtable}[c]{@{}lll@{}}
  \toprule
  Field Type & ~Field Label & ~Name\tabularnewline
  \midrule
  \endhead
  Text & ~Title & ~\texttt{title}\tabularnewline
  Text Box & ~Abstract & ~\texttt{abstract}\tabularnewline
  Image & ~Image & ~\texttt{image}\tabularnewline
  HTML & ~Body & ~\texttt{body}\tabularnewline
  \bottomrule
  \end{longtable}
\item
  Click \emph{Save}.
\item
  In the Manage Structures interface, click \emph{Choose} next to the
  News Article structure that you created.
\item
  In the New Web Content form, click \emph{Select} next to the Template
  heading to access the Manage Templates interface.
\item
  Click \emph{Add}, enter the name \emph{News Article}, and add a
  description.
\item
  Make sure FreeMarker is selected as the script language (it's the
  default).
\item
  If you've written the script beforehand, you can select \emph{Browse}
  to upload it from your machine. Otherwise, you can type the script
  directly into the script editor window.
\item
  Click \emph{Save}.
\item
  Exit the Manage Templates interface and click \emph{Select} next to
  the Template heading again.
\item
  Click \emph{Choose} next to the News Article template you created.
\item
  On the New Web Content form, you'll see the Title, Abstract, Image,
  and Body fields that you defined for the News Article structure. The
  News Article template should also be selected.
\item
  Populate the fields and click \emph{Publish} to publish your News
  Article.
\end{enumerate}

Below is the template script for this structure. It is written in
FreeMarker:

\begin{verbatim}
<#assign renderUrlMax = request["render-url-maximized"]>
<#assign namespace = request["portlet-namespace"]>
<#assign readmore = request.parameters?is_hash && getterUtil.getBoolean(request.parameters.read_more, false)>
<h1>${title.getData()}</h1>
<#if readmore>
<p>${abstract.getData()}</p>
<p>${body.getData()}</p>
<#else>
<p>
<img src="${image.getData()}" border="0" align="right">
${abstract.getData()}</p>
<a href="${renderUrlMax}&${namespace}read_more=true">Read More</a>
</#if>
\end{verbatim}

This template is small but accomplishes a lot. First, a portlet URL
which maximizes the portlet is created. Once this is done, the template
gets the namespace of the portlet. This is important to avoid URL
collisions with other URLs that might be on the page.

After this, the template attempts to get a request parameter called
\texttt{read\_more}. Whether or not this was successful is the key to
the rest of the script:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If the template got the \texttt{read\_more} parameter, it displays the
  abstract and the body below the title (which is always displayed).
\item
  If the template didn't get the \texttt{read\_more} parameter, it
  displays the image, the abstract and the link created above, which
  sets the \texttt{read\_more} parameter.
\end{itemize}

When this template is rendered, it looks something like Figure 3.5.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/03-adv-web-content-structures-templates-completed.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.5: The initial and expanded views for the Lunar Resort
News Article. After Clicking \emph{Read More}, you're able to read the
full text body.}
\end{figure}

New for Liferay 6.2 is the ability to create generic templates that
aren't connected to a specific structure. In previous versions of
Liferay, each template had to be associated with a structure. Now, you
have options for whether to permanently assign a template to a structure
or create a generic template and reuse its code for any structure. In
other words, generic templates can be embedded in other templates, which
allows for reusable code, JS library imports, or macros which will be
imported by Velocity or FreeMarker templates in the system.

Suppose you have three different Lunar Resort web content articles and
structures with similar aesthetics. Instead of creating three different
templates from scratch, you can use the same generic template for all
three and build off of it. This creates a smarter and more efficient
process when creating a multitude of similar web content articles.
Generic templates are created the same way as regular, structure-based
templates. The only setting that differs is the \emph{Structure} option,
which you'll need to leave blank to create a generic template.

For cases where you're creating your template within Liferay, you can
use the template editor. On the left side of the template editor, you'll
notice a palette of common variables used for making web content
templates. This is a great reference when creating your template. To
place one of the variables onto the template editor, simply position
your cursor where you want the variable placed, and click the variable
name. If the variable name doesn't give you sufficient information on
the variable's functionality, you can hover your pointer over it for a
more detailed description.

The interactive template editor is available for the FreeMarker and
Velocity languages. Depending on which language you select, the variable
content changes so you're always adding content in the language you've
chosen. Another cool feature for the template editor is the autocomplete
feature. It can be invoked by typing \emph{\$\{} which opens a drop-down
menu of available variables. By clicking one of the variables, the
editor inserts the variable into the template editor.

After you've saved your template, Liferay provides a WebDAV URL and
static URL. These values access the XML source of your structure. You
can find these URLs by returning to your template after it's been saved
and expanding the \emph{Details} section. For more information on WebDAV
and the uses of the WebDAV URL, reference the \emph{WebDAV access}
section in the \emph{Document Management} chapter.

more detailed description.}
\end{figure}

Now that you've created a handsome template and know how to use the
template editor, it's time to decide who the lucky people are that get
to use your new template.

\subsection{Assigning Template
Permissions}\label{assigning-template-permissions}

Permissions for templates are similar to permissions for structures. As
with structures, you only want specific developers editing and creating
templates. You may, however, want to make the templates viewable to some
content creators who understand the template scripting language but are
not directly writing the scripts. You can determine who views and
interacts with the template by navigating to \emph{Manage} →
\emph{Templates} and selecting \emph{Permissions} from the
\emph{Actions} button.

You can grant or deny permissions based on Roles. For instance, you may
create a role with the ability to update the template and create a
second role that can both update and delete. Liferay Portal makes it
possible to assign permissions based on the roles and responsibilities
within your organization.

Now that you understand the role structures and templates play in
creating web content, let's look at how to create RSS feeds in Liferay.

\section{Managing RSS Feeds in
Liferay}\label{managing-rss-feeds-in-liferay}

RSS is a family of web feed formats used to publish frequently updated
works such as blog entries and news articles. RSS allows users to stay
up-to-date with your site's content without actually having to visit
your site! Instead, they can subscribe to your site's RSS feed with an
RSS feed reader. Their RSS reader reads your site's RSS feed and
displays information about all the web content that's published on your
site, such as each article's title and publication date. If one of your
site's web content articles grabs their attention, then they can follow
their RSS reader's link to the article's full content on your site. Many
RSS readers are available today, including web-based readers, ones for
the Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms, and ones for mobile devices.
Let's see how to create RSS feeds in Liferay.

\subsection{Managing RSS Feeds from the Control
Panel}\label{managing-rss-feeds-from-the-control-panel}

To manage a Liferay site's RSS feeds, navigate to the Site
Administration $\rightarrow$Content page of your site and click \emph{Web Content}.
Site administrators can use this Web Content administration portlet to
manage their site's web content, including web content structures and
templates, which we examined above. Site administrators can also use the
Web Content administration portlet to manage their site's RSS feeds.
Click \emph{Manage} $\rightarrow$\emph{Feeds} if you'd like to add, edit, or delete
RSS feeds.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} The Web Content Feeds portlet is deprecated for Liferay
6.2 and will be removed in Liferay 7.0. The portlet will be migrated to
the Asset Publisher portlet.
\vspace{14pt}

\end{roundedframe}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/web-content-manage-feeds.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.7: Clicking \emph{Manage} $\rightarrow$\emph{Feeds} from the
Control Panel's Web Content administration portlet opens a popup window
which displays your site's RSS feeds. You can add or edit RSS feeds,
configure their permissions, or delete them.}
\end{figure}

Click the \emph{Add Feed} button to add a new feed. You need to enter a
name and select a target page for the feed. A feed's target page serves
two purposes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The site to which the target page belongs determines which web content
  articles appear in the feed. For example, if the target page belongs
  to the Marketing site, only web content articles belong to the
  Marketing site will appear in the feed.
\item
  The target page is the page where ``orphaned'' web content articles
  will be displayed. ``Orphaned'' web content articles are articles that
  have been published in your site but have not been configured to be
  displayed in specific Web Content Display portlets. Liferay RSS feeds
  can provide links to any published web content articles, both
  ``orphaned'' articles and articles that have been configured to be
  displayed in specific Web Content Display portlets. For articles that
  have been configured to be displayed in a specific portlet, the RSS
  feeds' links point to the portal page of that portlet. For
  ``orphaned'' articles, the RSS feeds' links point to the feed's target
  page. When users click on such links for ``orphaned'' articles, the
  full content of the ``orphaned'' article is displayed on the target
  page.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/web-content-new-feed.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.8: To create a new RSS feed, you only need to specify
a name and a target page. Of course, you can also configure other
features of the feed such as its permissions, web content constraints,
and presentation settings.}
\end{figure}

To specify a target page, you need to enter the target page's friendly
URL. Note that friendly URLs do not include the host name. For example,
the friendly URL of a public page called \emph{Welcome} belonging to a
site called \emph{Marketing} might look like this:
\texttt{/web/market\-ing/welcome}. Optionally, you can specify a target
portlet ID. This would be the portlet ID of a Web Content Display
portlet on the target page in which ``orphaned'' web content should be
displayed. The portlet must exist or else the content will not
displayed. The URL field contains the address of your RSS feed. It
appears after you've actually created the feed by clicking \emph{Save}.

The final two sections of the \emph{Add Feed} form allow you customize
which web content articles appear in your feed.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The Web Content Constraints section allows you to select a web content
  type and a structure with which to filter the articles that appear in
  your feed. You can select a particular type of web content such as
  \emph{Announcements}, \emph{News}, or \emph{Press Release}. Only
  articles of the type you select will appear in your feed. You can also
  choose for only web content articles that have a particular structure
  to appear in your feed. This is useful since customized kinds of web
  content articles are often created using web content structures.
\item
  The Presentation Settings section allows you to customize additional
  details about your feed and how articles are displayed in your feed.
  Leave the Feed Item Content set to \emph{Web Content Description} if
  you'd just like a description of each article to appear in your feed.
  Set it to \emph{Rendered Web Content: Use Default Template} if you'd
  like the full content of each article to appear in the feed.
  Customizing the Feed Type allows you to choose which web feed language
  to use for your feed. You can choose \emph{Atom 1.0} (the default),
  \emph{RSS 1.0}, or \emph{RSS 2.0}. Customize the \emph{Maximum Items
  to Display} to choose the maximum number of articles should appear in
  your feed at one time. Leave the Order By Column set to \emph{Modified
  Date} to have articles arranged in order from the last time they were
  published or modified. You can set the Order by Column to
  \emph{Display Date} if you want to have articles arranged in order
  from the time they were configured to be displayed in a specific Web
  Content Display portlet. Lastly, you can leave the Order by Type set
  to \emph{Ascending} to have the oldest articles at the top of the feed
  or you can set it to \emph{Descending} to have the newest articles at
  the top of the feed.
\end{enumerate}

When you're done configuring your RSS feed, you can click \emph{Preview}
to see how your feed looks. If you're satisfied, click \emph{Save} to
create your feed.

Once one or more feeds have been created, they'll appear in a list in
the Feeds popup window when you click \emph{Manage} $\rightarrow$\emph{Feeds}. You
can edit existing feeds using the same form used for creating them. The
main difference is that when you edit an existing feed, the URL field is
populated. Copy this URL into a new browser tab or window to test your
feed. From the Feeds popup window, you can also customize the
permissions of feeds or delete feeds.

It's possible to completely disable RSS feeds at the portal level. You
can do this by setting the \texttt{rss.feeds.enabled} property to
\texttt{false}. By default, it's set to \texttt{true}. If you keep the
default, RSS enabled, you can make several other RSS property
customizations. Please refer to the RSS section of your
\texttt{portal.properties} file for details.

\subsection{Using the RSS Portlet}\label{using-the-rss-portlet}

The RSS portlet allows you to display any number of RSS feeds and
configure how they are displayed. If you're looking for a web-based RSS
reader, look no further: just add the RSS portlet to one your personal
site's private pages, and voila! You have your own personal RSS reader.
Open the portlet's Configuration popup to select the feeds to be
displayed and customize the display. The RSS portlet can also be placed
on sites' public or private pages to make feeds available to guests or
site members, respectively. In these cases, make sure that only site
administrators have permission to customize the RSS portlet and select
feeds to be displayed.

Once you've added the RSS portlet to a page, open the portlet's
Configuration popup window by clicking on the gear icon at the top right
corner of the portlet and selecting \emph{Configuration}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/rss-portlet-config.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.9: The RSS portlet's configuration window lets you
choose feeds to be displayed and allows you to customize the display
settings.}
\end{figure}

By default, the RSS portlet displays two feeds. In the Feeds section,
click on the green plus sign to add a new feed or on the red minus sign
to remove a feed. Enter the URL of the RSS feed to display into the URL
field. If you leave the Title field blank, the feed's title appears in
the RSS portlet. If you enter a custom title into the Title field, the
custom title appears instead of the feed's title.

In the Display Settings section, use the following checkboxes to select
the feed details that should be displayed:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Show Feed Title
\item
  Show Feed Published Date
\item
  Show Feed Description
\item
  Show Feed Image
\item
  Show Feed Item Author
\end{itemize}

You can also select the number of entries and expanded entries that
should be displayed per feed. Expanded entries show more of an article's
actual content than regular entries. By default, each feed shows eight
entries per feed but only one expanded entry per feed. You can set the
feed image alignment to control whether feed images appear to the right
or left of the text. By default, the feed image alignment is set to
\emph{Right}. Finally, you can select a header web content and/or a
footer web content. These are web content articles that appear in the
RSS portlet either above all of the feeds or below all of the feeds. You
can use these to provide an introduction, description, or footnotes
about the feeds that you've selected to be displayed.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/rss-portlet-default-view.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.10: By default, the RSS portlet is configured to
display feeds from Liferay Community Blogs, Yahoo News, and the New York
Times. This image displays what the Liferay Community Blogs feed looks
like in the RSS portlet.}
\end{figure}

Now that we've discussed how to create, manage, and use RSS feeds, let's
examine site templates and page templates. Site templates are a powerful
tool for managing many similar sites. Let's examine how they work and
then we'll look at page templates.

\section{Using Site Templates}\label{using-site-templates}

Site Templates can be administered from the Control Panel. They allow
portal administrators to create multiple sites with the same default set
of pages and content. Site templates can contain multiple pages, each
with its own theme, layout template, portlets, and portlet
configurations. Site templates can also contain content just like actual
sites. This allows administrators to use site templates to create new
sites that are each created with the same default pages, portlets, and
content. After they've been created, these sites and their pages can be
modified by site administrators. Using site templates can save site
administrators a lot of work even if each site that was created from a
given site template ends up being very different.

To get started, click on \emph{Site Templates} in the Sites section of
the Control Panel. Here, you can add, manage, or delete site templates.
You can also configure the permissions of site templates. As long as a
site is linked to the site template it was created from, changes to the
site template's pages, portlets, and portlet configurations are
propagated to the site. Changes to a site template's content, however,
are not propagated to existing sites that are linked to the site
template. We discuss the propagation of changes between site templates
and sites in more detail in the section on site templates use cases
below.

To manage the pages of a site template, click on \emph{Site Templates}
in the Control Panel and then click \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Manage}.
You're provided a left menu which contains the \emph{Pages},
\emph{Content}, and \emph{Configuration} sections for each site. By
default, the Manage Interface begins with the template's \emph{Site
Pages}. From here, you can add or remove pages from a site template or
select themes and layout templates to apply to the site template. Click
on a specific page if you'd like to select a different theme or layout
template for that page. To edit the pages themselves, click
\emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$ \emph{View Pages}. You can add specific portlets to
each page of a site template and configure the preferences of each
portlet. Each page can have any theme, any layout template, and any
number of portlet applications, just like a page of a regular site. As
with site pages, you can organize the pages of a site template into
hierarchies. When you create a site using a site template, the
configuration of pages and portlets is copied from the template to the
site. By default, all changes made to the site template are
automatically copied to sites based on that template.

\clearpage

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} If you want to publish a piece of web content to many
sites and ensure modifications are applied to all, don't use site
template content for that purpose. Instead, place the content in the
global scope and then reference it from a \emph{Web Content Display}
application in each site.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}

The Content section offers separate repositories for content related
portlets based on your site template. For instance, by clicking
\emph{Polls} from the Content section, you can create a poll question
that is only available for that specific site template. Assets created
within your template's Content section can only be accessed by sites
using the template.

Lastly, the Configuration section includes Application Display Template
and Mobile Device configuration options for your site template. Also,
nested in the Configuration section is the \emph{Site Template
Settings}. This option allows you to edit the template's name and
description while also offering boolean options for activating your site
template and allowing site administrators to modify pages associated
with your template.

The following figure displays the form shown when editing the
\emph{Community Site} template's settings:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-site-templates.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.11: Site templates have several configurable options
including the option to allow site administrators to modify pages
accociated with the site template.}
\end{figure}

By default, the following site templates are provided:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Community Site:} Provides a preconfigured site for building
  online communities. The Home page of a \emph{community site} provides
  message boards, search, a display of a poll and statistics of the
  activity of community members. The site will also be created with a
  page for a community calendar and a page for a wiki.
\item
  \textbf{Intranet Site:} Provides a preconfigured site for an intranet.
  The Home page displays the activities of the members of the site,
  search, a language chooser and a list of the recent content created in
  the intranet. It also provides 3 additional pages for \emph{Documents
  and Media}, \emph{Calendar} and external \emph{News} obtained through
  public feeds.
\end{itemize}

Now that you know the basics for creating and managing your site
templates, let's put your knowledge to the test by completing an
example.

\subsection{Site Templates Example}\label{site-templates-example}

Suppose we need to create the following three sites for the Lunar
Resort's internal use: Engineering, Marketing, and Legal. These should
be private sites that are only accessible to members of these respective
departments. We could design each site separately but can save ourselves
some work if we create a site template to use instead.

To create a site template, navigate to the Control Panel and click
\emph{Site Templates}. Then click \emph{Add} and enter a name for your
template: we'll use \emph{Department} for our example. Leave the
\emph{Active} and \emph{Allow Site Administrators to Modify the Pages
Associated with This Site Template} boxes checked. The \emph{Active} box
must be checked for your template to be usable. If your template is
still a work in progress, you can uncheck it to ensure that no one uses
it until it's ready. Checking \emph{Allow Site Administrators to Modify
the Pages Associated with This Site Template} allows site administrators
to modify or remove the pages and portlets that the template introduces
to their sites--if you want the templates to be completely static, you
should uncheck this. Click \emph{Save} to create your site template.

From the left menu, select the \emph{Pages} section and click \emph{Site
Pages}. Then click on the \emph{View Pages} button to begin adding pages
and portlets and configuring the layouts. When you click this button,
the site template opens in a new browser tab or window. For our example,
we would like our site template to include four pages. First, we'd like
a Home page with the Activities, Announcements, and Calendar portlets.
Next, we'd like a Documents and Media page with the Documents and Media
portlet. Finally, we should create a Wiki page with the Wiki and Tag
Cloud portlets and a Message Boards page with the Message Boards and Tag
Cloud portlets. When you're done creating and configuring the pages of
your site template, just close the browser tab or window that opened
when you clicked \emph{View Pages}. Changes to site templates are
automatically saved as you make them, so you don't need to return to the
Site Templates page of the Control Panel and select \emph{Save}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/editing-site-template.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.12: You can see the name of the site template you're
currently editing.}
\end{figure}

Next, let's use our site template to create our Engineering, Marketing
and Legal sites. Go to the Control Panel and click on \emph{Sites}. Then
click \emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Department}. Enter \emph{Engineering} for the
site name and set the Membership Type to \emph{Private}. Recall that
private sites don't appear in the My Sites portlet so that regular
portal users won't even know that the Engineering site exists. Also, the
only way users can be added to a private site is via an invitation from
a site administrator. Leave the \emph{Active} box checked so that your
site can be used immediately. Select the \emph{Copy as Private Pages}
option since our Engineering site is intended for internal use only.
Leave the \emph{Enable propagation of changes from the site template}
box checked so that the Engineering site receives updates if the
Department site template is modified. Finally, click \emph{Save} to
create your Engineering site.

Repeat these steps to create the Marketing and Legal sites. The new
sites have all the pages and portlets you created in the site template.
To view the pages of the new sites, click on \emph{Sites} in the Control
Panel and then click on \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Go to Private Pages} next
to one of your new sites. Using site templates streamlines the site
creation process for administrators, making it easy to create sites
quickly. Now each department of the Lunar Resort has its own calendar,
documents and media library, wiki, and message boards application.
Although the pages and portlets of each department's site are the same,
each site will quickly be filled with department-specific information as
users add and share content within the sites. Also, site administrators
can add new pages, portlets, and content to their sites, further
differentiating each department's site from the others.

\subsection{Propagating Changes from Site Templates to
Sites}\label{propagating-changes-from-site-templates-to-sites}

It's possible for site template administrators to add, update, or delete
site template pages. Changes made to a site template can be propagated
to sites whose page sets are linked to the site template. Such a link is
created when you create a site based on a site template and leave the
\emph{Enable propagation of changes from the site template} box checked.
To disable or re-enable this link for a site, select the site from
\emph{My Sites} in the Dockbar. Navigate to \emph{Admin} →
\emph{Configuration} to open the \emph{Site Settings} page and uncheck
or recheck the \emph{Enable propagation of changes from the site
template} checkbox. In this section, we explain the propagation of
changes from site templates to sites and discuss the options available
to site administrators and site template administrators.

If a site's page set has been created from a site template and the
propagation of changes from the site template is enabled, site
administrators can add new pages but cannot remove or reorder the pages
imported from the site template. If a site has both pages imported from
a site template and custom site pages, the site template pages always
appear first; custom pages added by site administrators appear after the
site template pages. Only site template administrators can remove,
reorder, or add site template pages. Site administrators can add or
remove custom site pages. They can also reorder custom site pages as
long as they're all positioned after the site template pages. Site
template administrators cannot add, remove, or reorder custom site
pages.

If a site administrator changes a page that was imported from a site
template and refreshes the page, the following message appears:

\begin{verbatim}
    This page has been changed since the last update from the site template.
    No further updates from the site template will be applied. Click *Reset*
    to overwrite the changes and receive updates from the site template.
\end{verbatim}

If the site administrator clicks the \emph{Reset} button, changes are
propagated from the site template page to the corresponding site page
that was imported from the site template. Clicking the \emph{Reset}
button makes two kinds of updates to a page. First, changes made by site
administrators to the site page are undone. Second, changes made by site
template administrators to the site template page are applied to the
site page. Note: clicking the \emph{Reset} button only resets one page.
If multiple site pages have been modified and you'd like to re-apply the
site template pages to them, you'll need to click the \emph{Reset}
button for each page.

Site template administrators can set preferences for portlets on site
template pages. When a portal administrator creates a site from a site
template, the portlet preferences are copied from the site template's
portlets, overriding any default portlet preferences. When merging site
template and site changes, e.g., when resetting, portlet preferences are
copied from site template portlets to site portlets. Only global portlet
preferences or local portlet preferences which don't refer to IDs are
overwritten.

In some cases, merging site template and site changes fails. For
example, if pages from a site template cannot be propagated because
their friendly URLs are in conflict, the portal could try to
continuously merge the site changes. Instead of entering into an
infinite loop of merge fails, Liferay stops the merge after several
unsuccessful attempts. However, Liferay doesn't stop there: your merge
is temporarily paused, you're given an indication of the current merge
fail, and then you have the opportunity to fix your merge conflicts.
After you've squared away your conflict, navigate to \emph{Site
Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Configuration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site Settings} and click
the \emph{Reset and Propagate} button.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/reset-and-propagate.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.13: You can reset and propagate the merge fail count
by navigationg to \emph{Site Settings}.}
\end{figure}

The \emph{Reset and Propagate} button resets the merge fail count and
attempts to propagate your site changes again. This process gives the
portal administrator the opportunity to detect and fix a merge fail,
when problems arise. This helpful process can also be done with page
template merges, which follows similar steps.

Site administrators can also add data to site template portlets. For
example, site template administrators can add the Wiki portlet to a site
template page and use the Wiki to create lots of articles. When a portal
administrator creates a site from a site template, data is copied from
the site template's portlets to the site's portlets. The preferences of
the site's portlets are updated with the IDs of the copied data. For
example, if a site is created from a site template that has a Wiki
portlet with lots of wiki articles, the wiki articles are copied from
the site template's scope to the site's scope and site's Wiki portlet is
updated with the IDs of the copied wiki articles.

\textbf{Important:} Portlet data, related resources, and permissions on
resources are only copied from a site template to a site when that site
is \emph{first} created based on the template. No changes made in a a
template's portlet data, related resources, or permissions are
propagated to the site after the site is created. Neither are such
changes propagated to a site by \emph{Reset} or \emph{Reset and
Propagate} features.

For example, consider a site template administrator who includes a
Message Boards portlet as part of a site template. She even creates
Message Board categories and configures permissions over the actions of
the categories. The first time a site is created based on the site
template, the categories (portlet data) and related permissions are
copied to the site. If the site template administrator adds, removes, or
deletes some categories, however, such changes \emph{aren't} propagated
to the site.

Now that we've learned how site templates work, let's discuss how to use
page templates.

\section{Using Page Templates}\label{using-page-templates}

Click on \emph{Page Templates} in the Control Panel to see a list of
page templates. Page templates function similarly to site templates but
at the page level. Each page template provides a pre-configured page to
reuse. Within a page template, it's possible to select a theme, a layout
template, to add portlets to the page and to configure portlet
preferences. Both sites and site templates can utilize page templates
for creating new pages.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/server-configuration-page-templates.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.14: The Blog page template is already available for
use along with the Content Display Page and Wiki page templates.}
\end{figure}

You can edit or delete existing page templates, configure their
permissions, or add new page templates. By default, three sample page
templates are provided:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Blog:} provides a page with three applications related to
  blogging. It has two columns, the main left column contains the blogs
  portlet and the small right column provides two side portlets, Tag
  Cloud and Recent Bloggers. The tag cloud application will show the
  tags used within the site and will allow navigating through the blog
  entries shown in the main blogs portlet.
\item
  \textbf{Content Display Page:} provides a page preconfigured to
  display content. It has three auxiliary applications (Tags Navigation,
  Categories Navigation, and Search) and an Asset Publisher. The most
  significant aspect of this page is that the Asset Publisher is
  preconfigured to be display any web content associated with this page.
  This means that you can select any page created from this page
  template as a \emph{Display Page} for a web content article. You can
  choose a display page for a web content article when creating a new
  web content article or when editing an existing one. When you create a
  new web content article, a unique (canonical) URL for the web content
  pointing to this page will be assigned to it.
\item
  \textbf{Wiki:} provides a page with three applications related to
  authoring a wiki. It also has two columns, the main left column with
  the wiki application and two right side portlets to allow navigating
  through pages by tags and categories.
\end{itemize}

To add a new page template, click the \emph{Add} button. Then enter a
name and description for your template. Leave the \emph{Active} button
checked. Click \emph{Save} and then identify your page template in the
list. Click its name or use the Actions button to edit the page
template. The \emph{Open Page Template} link opens a new browser window
which you can use to configure your new page. Any changes you make are
automatically saved so you can close the new browser window once you're
done.

Note that after a new page template has been created the default
permissions are to only allow the creator to use the page template. To
give other users access to it, use the actions menu in the list of
templates and choose \emph{Permissions}. Once you see the matrix of
roles and permissions, check the \emph{View} permission for the role or
roles needed to see the page template in the list of available page
templates when creating a new page. If you want any user who can create
a page to be able to use the page template, just check the \emph{View}
permission for the \emph{User} role.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/selecting-page-template.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.15: When creating a new site page, you're given
options for the page template and page type.}
\end{figure}

To use your template to create a new page, just navigate to a page over
which you have site administrator privileges and select \emph{Add} →
\emph{Page} from the left menu. You'll be able to select a page template
and type a name for the new page. Alternatively, you can use the Site
Administration page. First, make sure you're on your desired site and
navigate to \emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site Administration}. Then click on
\emph{Site Pages} $\rightarrow$\emph{Add Page}, type a name, select your template
from the drop down menu, and click \emph{Add Page} to finish.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/automatic-application-page-template-changes.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.16: You can choose whether or not to automatically
apply page template changes to live pages.}
\end{figure}

Note that by default, when a site administrator creates pages based on a
page template, any future changes to the template are automatically
propagated to those pages. Site administrators can disable this behavior
by unchecking the \emph{Automatically apply changes done to the page
template} box. Occasionally, propagation for page templates fails due to
unintended errors. To learn how to manage a failed page template
propagation, visit the \emph{Propagating Changes from Site Templates to
Sites} section of this chapter.

If staging has been enabled, changes to the page template are
automatically propagated to the staged page. These changes still need to
be approved before the page is published to live. For this reason, the
automatic propagation of page template changes to the staged page cannot
be turned off and the \emph{Automatically apply changes done to the page
template} checkbox does not appear.

We'll discuss staging in more detail later in this chapter. For now
let's look at importing and exporting templates.

\subsection{Exporting and Importing Site Templates and Page
Templates}\label{exporting-and-importing-site-templates-and-page-templates}

If you want to export a site that uses site or page templates to a
different environment (through a LAR file or remote publication), the
templates must be exported and imported manually in advance or the
import will fail.

To export a Site using a Site Template, use the following process:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Go to \emph{Control Panel} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site Templates} and click
  \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Manage} for the Site Template your site is
  using.
\item
  Click \emph{Export} to obtain a LAR file with the content of the Site
  Template. Be sure to choose the applications and data you want
  exported.
\item
  In your target environment, go to \emph{Control Panel} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site
  Templates} and create a new Site Template.
\item
  Click \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Manage Pages} for that Site Template and
  then click \emph{Import}.
\item
  Upload the LAR file containing your site template's content.
\end{enumerate}

Now the site can be exported and imported normally to this new
environment.

For page templates, the process very similar:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Go to \emph{Control Panel} $\rightarrow$\emph{Page Templates}.
\item
  Next to the page template you would like to export, click
  \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Export}. This produces a LAR file you can
  import later.
\item
  On the target environment, go to \emph{Control Panel} $\rightarrow$\emph{Page
  Templates} and create a new Page Template.
\item
  Next to the new template, click \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Import}.
\item
  Upload the LAR file containing the exported page template from step 3.
\end{enumerate}

The page template can now be imported normally to this new environment.

Next, let's examine the tools Liferay provides for handling
translations.

\section{Localization}\label{localization}

When you create a new piece of Web Content, you have the ability to
choose a default language. If you click \emph{Change}, you can select
your default language from a large number of languages Liferay supports.
Before you can create a translation, you must finish creating the
content in your default language and save it. Once you've done that,
editing the content provides you with the option to \emph{Add
Translation}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-translation.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.17: You have many translation languages to choose from
for your web content.}
\end{figure}

After you click \emph{Add Translation}, you can select a language by
scrolling through the list or by entering the language you want to use
in the search box. When you select a language, a new window opens within
your browser enabling you to translate the original web content into the
selected language. Once you are done with the translation, click
\emph{Save} and the translation is added to the list of \emph{Available
Translations}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-translation-2.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.18: After typing your translated text, you can
summarize the translation in the \emph{Abstract} section.}
\end{figure}

You can modify the language translation list by inserting
\texttt{lo\-cales.enabled=} followed by your preferred languages in your
\texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file. For example,
\texttt{lo\-cales.en\-a\-bled=ar\_SA,nl\_NL,hi\_IN} offers \emph{Arabic (Saudi
Arabia)}, \emph{Dutch (Neth\-er\-lands)}, and \emph{Hindi (India)}.

The ability to completely delete a translation in one step has also been
added. Instead of simply disabling a translation or having to go through
a multistep process to remove it, you can now simply open the
translation you don't want and click \emph{Remove Translation}.

When you create a new web content structure, each field you create has a
\emph{Localizable} checkbox displayed next to it. This enables you to
control what can and can't be changed in the translation process. For
example, if you don't want images or content titles to be changed when
the content is translated, you can make sure those fields aren't listed
as localizable. When you follow the steps above to localize content,
only fields within the structure that had the \emph{Localizable} box
checked appear within the translation window.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} The Localizable checkbox was removed for 6.2 CE GA1 and
GA2, and 6.2 EE GA1, SP1, and SP2. However, the Localizable checkbox is
now available for Liferay following these versions for web content
structure fields. You can view
\href{https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-33161}{LPS-33161} for more
details.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}
Next, we'll discuss how to let users customize their site pages.

\section{Allowing Users to Customize Site
Pages}\label{allowing-users-to-customize-site-pages}

As we discussed before, as your site becomes larger and more complex,
management of the content becomes more challenging. We've gone over
Liferay management tools that help you create content quickly and in an
orderly fashion. You created a simple announcement with Liferay's
structure editor that allows you to quickly design a structure and
prepare it for the template designers. Then you applied a template to
the structure. You know how to display content using the Web Content
Display portlet. Now, you're ready to take advantage of Liferay's
advanced publishing options.

If a web site isn't properly managed, it can quickly become stale and
that drives viewers away. If people are finding your site because of
search engines, you don't want them presented with outdated (and
possibly inaccurate) web content. You also want your content to be found
easily by your users. This is done through tags and categories.

Additionally, you may want to create content and send it through an
approval and review process weeks before you want it displayed on the
web site. Liferay gives you this flexibility with the \emph{Schedule}
and \emph{Workflow} features.

\section{Scheduling Web Content}\label{scheduling-web-content}

Liferay's WCM lets you define when your content goes live. You can
determine when the content is displayed, expired and/or reviewed. This
is an excellent way to keep your site current and free from outdated
(and perhaps incorrect) information. The scheduler is built right into
the form your users access to add web content. Specifically, it can be
found in the right panel listed with several other configurable
settings.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-schedule.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.19: The web content scheduler can be easily accessed
from the right panel of the page.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Display Date:} Sets (within a minute) when content will be
displayed.

\textbf{Expiration Date:} Sets a date to expire the content. The default
is one year.

\textbf{Never Auto Expire:} Sets your content to never expire.

\textbf{Review Date:} Sets a content review date.

\textbf{Never Review:} Sets the content to never be reviewed.

As you can see, the scheduling feature in Liferay Portal gives you great
control in managing when, and for how long, your web content is
displayed on your web site. Additionally, you have the ability to
determine when your content should be reviewed for accuracy and/or
relevance. This makes it possible to manage your growing inventory of
content.

Similar to scheduling, Liferay's staging feature also allows you to
manipulate time, in a manner of speaking.

\section{Staging Page Publication}\label{staging-page-publication}

Staging is an important feature of Liferay WCM. The concept of staging
is a simple one: you can modify your site behind the scenes and then
publish all your updates in one shot. You don't want users seeing your
web site change before their eyes as you're modifying it, do you?
Liferay's staging environment allows you to make changes to your site in
a specialized \emph{staging area}. When you're finished, you can publish
all your site changes at once.

Liferay provides site administrators with two different ways to set up
staging: Local Live and Remote Live. With Local Live staging, both your
staging environment and your live environment are hosted on the same
server. When Local Live staging is enabled for a site, a clone of the
site is created containing copies of all of the site's existing pages.
Portlet data is also copied, depending on which portlets are selected
when staging is enabled. The cloned site becomes the staging environment
and the original site becomes the live environment.

When Remote Live staging is enabled for a site, a connection is
established between the current site and another site on a remote
Liferay server. The remote site becomes the live environment and the
current site becomes the staging environment--an instance of Liferay
Portal used solely for staging. Content creators can use the staging
server to make their changes while the live server handles the incoming
user traffic. When changes to the site are ready to be published, they
are pushed over the network to the remote live server. Whether you
enable Local Live or Remote Live staging, the interface for managing and
publishing staged pages is the same.

So when should you use Local Live staging and when should you use Remote
Live Staging? Local Live staging allows you to publish site changes very
quickly, since the staged and live environments are on the same server.
It's also easier to switch between the staged and live environments
using Local Live staging. However, since the staged content is stored in
the same database as the production content, the content isn't as well
protected or backed up as with Remote Live staging. Also, you can't
install new versions of portlets for testing purposes in a Local Live
staging environment since only one version of a portlet can be installed
at any given time on a single Liferay server.

With Remote Live staging, your staging and live environments are hosted
on separate servers. This allows you to deploy new versions of portlets
and content to your staging environment without worrying about
interfering with your live environment. With Remote Live staging, you
can also use one Liferay instance as the staging server for multiple
production servers. However, publishing is slower with Remote Live than
with Local Live since data needs to be transferred over a network. And,
of course, you need more hardware to run a separate staging server.

Liferay also offers the Page Versioning feature. This feature works with
both Local Live and Remote Live staging and allows site administrators
to create multiple variations of staged pages. This allows several
different versions of sites and pages to be developed at the same time.
Variations can be created, merged, and published using a Git-like
versioning system. Let's jump in to see how to use staging.

\subsection{Enabling Local Live
Staging}\label{enabling-local-live-staging}

Site administrators can enable Staging for a site via the Site Settings
UI. To reach this interface, navigate to the \emph{Site Administration}
$\rightarrow$\emph{Configuration} page of your site, make sure \emph{Site Settings}
is highlighted in the left menu, and click on \emph{Staging} listed
under the Advanced tab. Under Staging Type, select either \emph{Local
Live} or \emph{Remote Live} and additional options appear. Staging
allows changes to be made in a staging environment so that work can be
reviewed, possibly using a workflow, before it's published to a live
site. Enabling Local Live staging is easy. Just select \emph{Local Live}
and decide whether you'd like to enable page versioning. You can enable
page versioning on a site's public pages, private pages, both, or
neither. Page versioning allows you to work in parallel on different
versions of pages and maintains a history of all page modifications. We
discuss page versioning in more detail below.

\subsection{Enabling Remote Live
Staging}\label{enabling-remote-live-staging}

When you enable Remote Live staging, the remote site becomes the live
environment and the current site becomes the staging environment. The
remote (live) Liferay server and the local (staging) Liferay server
should be completely separate systems. They should not, for example,
share the same the database. When Remote Live staging is enabled, all
the necessary information is transferred over the network connecting the
two servers.

Before a site administrator can enable Remote Live staging for a site,
the remote Liferay server must be added to the current Liferay server's
list of allowed servers. The current Liferay server must also be added
to the remote Liferay server's list of allowed servers. You also need to
specify an authentication key to be shared by your current and your
remote server and enable each Liferay server's tunneling servlet
authentication verifier. You can make all of these configurations in
your Liferay servers' \texttt{portal-ext.properties} files. Your first
step should be to add the following lines to your current Liferay
server's \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
tunnel.servlet.hosts.allowed=127.0.0.1,SERVER_IP,[Remote server IP address]
axis.servlet.hosts.allowed=127.0.0.1,SERVER_IP,192.168.0.16,[Remote server IP address]
tunneling.servlet.shared.secret=[secret]
auth.verifier.TunnelingServletAuthVerifier.hosts.allowed=
\end{verbatim}

Then add the following lines to your remote Liferay server's
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
tunnel.servlet.hosts.allowed=127.0.0.1,SERVER_IP,[Local server IP address]
axis.servlet.hosts.allowed=127.0.0.1,SERVER_IP,192.168.0.16,[Local server IP address]
tunneling.servlet.shared.secret=[secret]
auth.verifier.TunnelingServletAuthVerifier.hosts.allowed=
\end{verbatim}

Liferay's use of a pre-shared key between your staging and production
environments helps secure the remote publication process. It also
removes the need to send the publishing user's password to the remote
server for web service authentication. Using a pre-shared key allows
Liferay to create an authorization context (permission checker) from the
provided email address, screen name, or user ID \emph{without} the
user's password. You can specify any value for the
\texttt{tunneling.servlet.shared.secret} property; the value for your
current server just has to match the value of your remote server.
Remember to restart both Liferay servers after making these portal
properties updates. After restarting, log back in to your local Liferay
portal instance as a site administrator. Then navigate to the \emph{Site
Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Configuration} page for your site. Next, click
on \emph{Site Settings} in the left menu and then on \emph{Staging}
listed under the Advanced tab. Select \emph{Remote Live} under Staging
Type and additional options appear.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/remote-live-staging-settings.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.20: After your remote Liferay server and local Liferay
server have been configured to communicate with each other, you have to
specify a few Remote Live connection settings.}
\end{figure}

First, enter your remote Liferay server's IP address into the Remote
Host/IP field. If the remote Liferay server is a cluster, you can set
the Remote Host/IP to the load balanced IP address of the cluster in
order to increase the availability of the publishing process. Next,
enter the port on which the remote Liferay instance is running into the
Remote Port field. You only need to enter a Remote Path Context if a
non-root portal servlet context is being used on the remote Liferay
server. Finally, enter the site ID of the site on the remote Liferay
server that will be used for the Live environment. If a site hasn't
already been prepared for you on the remote Liferay server, you can log
in to the remote Liferay server and create a new blank site. After the
site has been created, note the site ID so you can enter it into the
Remote Site ID field on your local Liferay server. You can find any
site's ID by selecting \emph{Actions $\rightarrow$Edit} next to the site's name on
the Sites page of the Control Panel. Finally, it's best to check the
\emph{Use a Secure Network Connection} field to use HTTPS for the
publication of pages from your local (staging) Liferay server to your
remote (live) Liferay server.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} In general, remote staging should be enabled for a site as
early as possible. It's generally \emph{not} a good idea to add
gigabytes of data into Liferay's CMS and then decide to turn on remote
staging. There's an existing issue that limits Liferay to less than 2G
of data for publishing data to a remote staging server:
\url{http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-35317}. You can check this
issue to see if it's been resolved and to find out which versions of
Liferay it affects.

\end{roundedframe}
That's all you need to do to enable Remote Live Staging! Note that if
you fail to set the tunneling servlet shared secret or the values of
these properties on your current and remote servers don't match, you
won't be able to enable staging and an error message appears. When a
user attempts to publish changes from the local (staging) server to the
remote (live) server, Liferay passes the user's email address, screen
name, or user ID to the remote server to perform a permission check. In
order for a publishing operation to succeed, the operation must be
performed by a user that has identical credentials and permissions on
both the local (staging) and the remote (live) server. This is true
regardless of whether the user attempts to publish the changes
immediately or attempts to schedule the publication for later.

If only a few users should have permission to publish changes from
staging to production, it's easy enough to create a few user accounts on
the remote server that match a selected few on the local server.
However, the more user accounts that you have to create, the more
tedious this job becomes and the more likely you are to make a mistake.
And you not only have to create identical user accounts, you also have
to ensure that these users have identical permissions. For this reason,
we recommend that you use LDAP to copy selected user accounts from your
local (staging) Liferay server to your remote (live) Liferay server.
Liferay's Virtual LDAP Server application (EE-only), available on
Liferay Marketplace, makes this easy.

Next, you'll learn how to configure your portal to use IPv6 addresses
for Remote Live Staging.

\paragraph{Validating IPv6 Addresses}\label{validating-ipv6-addresses}

If your portal is set up to validate IPv6 addresses, you'll need to
configure your Remote Live Connection Settings. Restart your Liferay
instance and navigate back to the Staging page. Select the \emph{Remote
Live} radio selector and specify the fields for your remote site. The
\emph{Remote Host/IP} field should match the host you specified as your
\texttt{tunnel.servlet.hosts.allowed} property in the
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file (e.g.,
\emph{{[}0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1{]}}). Make sure to include the brackets. Fill
in the rest of the information relevant to your site and click
\emph{Save}.

To check if the remote site is running on an IPv6 address, add a new
portlet to the staged site, and then select \emph{Staging} →
\emph{Publish to Remote Live} from the Dockbar. The changes are
published to your remote staged site.

Your portal instance now validates the IPv6 address you specified for
your remote live site. Great job!

Next, you'll learn how to enable local live staging.

\subsection{Example: Enabling Local Live
Staging}\label{example-enabling-local-live-staging}

Let's create a Local Live staging environment for the Lunar Resort home
page. Before we begin, let's add a new page. Click \emph{Add $\rightarrow$Page}
from the left side menu in the default site and name the new page
\emph{News and Events}. Next, click \emph{News and Events} to view the
page. Then add the Alerts and Announcements portlets to the News and
Events page.

When you activate staging Local Live staging, Liferay creates a clone of
your site. This clone became the staging environment. Because of this,
we recommend only activating staging on new, clean sites. Having a few
pages and some portlets (like those of the example site we've created)
is no big deal. However, if you have already created a large amount of
content you might not be able to enable staging on that site. Also, if
you intend to use page versioning to track the history of updates to
your site, we recommend that you enable it as early as possible,
\emph{before} your site has many pages and lots of content. Your site's
update history won't be saved until you enable page versioning. Page
versioning requires staging (either Local Live or Remote Live) to be
enabled.

Now you're ready to activate staging for this site. Go to \emph{Admin} →
\emph{Site Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Configuration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site Settings}
and select \emph{Staging} from under the \emph{Advanced} heading. We'll
assume you don't have a separate staging server, so select the
\emph{Local Live} staging type. If you do have a separate server to use
for staging, follow the instructions in the previous section for
configuring it and your local server for remote staging. Either way,
once you make a selection (either \emph{Local Live} or \emph{Remote
Live}), more options become available for page versioning and staged
portlets.

\subsection{Enabling Page Versioning and Staged
Portlets}\label{enabling-page-versioning-and-staged-portlets}

Enabling page versioning for a site allows site administrators to work
in parallel on multiple versions of the site's pages. Page versioning
also maintains a history of all updates to the site from the time page
versioning was enabled. Site administrators can revert to a previous
version of the site at any time. This flexibility is very important in
cases where a mistake is found and it's important to quickly publish a
fix. If you're following the Lunar Resort example, check \emph{Enabled
On Public Pages} to enable page versioning for the Lunar Resort site and
then click \emph{Save}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-staging.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.21: You can decide to use versioning and choose what
content should be staged.}
\end{figure}

Before you activate staging, you can choose which portlets' data should
be copied to staging. We'll cover many of the collaboration portlets
listed under the Staged Portlets heading when we come to chapter 8. For
now, you just need to be aware that you can enable or disable staging
for any of these portlets. Why might you want to enable staging for some
portlet types but not others? In the case of collaborative portlets, you
probably \emph{don't} want to enable staging since such portlets are
designed for user interaction. If their content were staged, you'd have
to manually publish your site whenever somebody posted a message on the
message boards to make that message appear on the live site. Generally,
you'll want web content to be staged because end users aren't creating
that kind of content--web content is the stuff you publish to your site.
But portlets like the Message Boards or Wiki would likely benefit from
\emph{not} being staged. Notice which portlets are marked for staging by
default: if you enable staging and accept the defaults, staging is
\emph{not} enabled for the collaborative portlets.

\subsection{Using the Staging
Environment}\label{using-the-staging-environment}

After enabling staging (either Local Live or Remote Live) for a site,
you'll notice a colored bar with some new menus on the Dockbar when you
navigate to the site. These new menus help us manage staged pages.
You'll also notice that most of your page management options have been
removed, because now you can't directly edit live pages. You now must
use the staging environment to make changes. Click on the \emph{Staging}
button to view the staged area. Your management options are restored and
you can access some new options related to staging. If you're following
along with the Lunar Resort example, navigate back to the News and
Events page and click on \emph{Staging} to get your page editing
capabilities back.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-staging-live-page.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.22: You can see the new staging options added to the
top of your screen.}
\end{figure}

Add the Bookmarks portlet and then click on \emph{Live} from the
Dockbar. Notice that the Bookmarks portlet isn't there. That's because
you've staged a change to the page but haven't published that change yet
to the live site. Go back to the staged page and click on the
\emph{Staging} drop-down menu to look at the options you have available.
From here you have many options to choose from to help in your staging
conquest.

\textbf{Manage Site Pages Variations:} allows you to work in parallel on
multiple versions of a staged site page. We'll explain this later.

\textbf{Manage Page Variations:} allows you to work in parallel on
multiple versions of a staged page. We'll explain this later.

\textbf{Undo/Redo:} allows you to step back/forward through recent
changes to a page, which can save you the time of manually adding or
removing portlets if you make a mistake.

\textbf{History:} shows you the list of revisions of the page, based on
publication dates. You can go to any change in the revision history and
see how the pages looked at that point.

\textbf{Mark as Ready for Publication:} After you're done making changes
to the staged page, click this button. The status of the page changes
from \emph{Draft} to \emph{Ready for Publication} and any changes you've
made can be published to the Live Site. When you publish a page to live,
only the version which was \emph{Marked as Ready for Publication} is
published.

The \emph{Publish to Live} button gives you the option to publish to
Live \emph{Now} or \emph{Schedule} a publication to Live.

\textbf{Now:} immediately pushes any changes to the Live Site.

\textbf{Schedule:} lets you set a specific date to publish or to set up
recurring publishing. You could use this, for example, to publish all
changes made during the week every Monday morning without any further
intervention.

The \emph{Publish to Live} button also gives you options to select
pages, applications, content, and permissions. Furthermore, you're given
the \emph{Current and Previous} and \emph{Scheduled} tabs. The
\emph{Current and Previous} tab lets you view past publications along
with their authors and create/completion dates. The \emph{Scheduled} tab
lets you view what publication processes are scheduled for publishing.

\textbf{Pages} gives you the option to choose which pages to include
when you publish. You can see the default settings in the gray text
below the header. Click the \emph{Change} button to configure these
options to suite your needs.

\textbf{Application Configuration} allows you to select which
applications you want to publish. Select the \emph{Choose Applications}
radio button to configure the applications and settings to be published.

\textbf{Content} allows you to configure the content to be published.
Clicking the \emph{select} option under All Content allows you to delete
the portlet metadata before publishing.

\textbf{Permissions} allows you to include permissions for the pages and
portlets when the changes are published.

Furthermore, you're given the Current and Previous and Scheduled tabs.
The Current and Previous tab lets you view past publications along with
their authors and create/completion dates. The Scheduled tab lets you
view what publication processes are scheduled for publishing.

Click on \emph{Mark as Ready for Publication}, then click \emph{Publish
to Live} $\rightarrow$\emph{Now}, and select \emph{Publish} to publish your
Bookmarks portlet to the live site.

Content publication can be also controlled using staging. Bookmarks are
staged by default (this can be changed in Staging Configuration). If you
create a bookmark in the staged site, it isn't visible in the live site
until you publish it to the live site following the same steps you just
performed (you can select which types of content are published when you
publish to the live site). If workflow is enabled for any new resource,
the resource needs to go through the workflow process before it can be
published to the live site.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-staging-publish.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.23: Ready to publish to the live site.}

Web content tends to be frequently updated, often more so than other
kinds of content. For some web content articles, this can result in very
high numbers of versions, sometimes hundreds. Such high version numbers
can make it very slow to publish web content articles. Liferay addresses
this issue by allowing site administrators to choose whether or not to
publish a web content article's version history when a staged article is
ready to be published. To use this feature, staging must be enabled.
Edit a web content article that's being displayed in a Web Content
Display portlet on one of your pages and then click \emph{Staging} →
\emph{Publish to Live} from the Dockbar. In the popup, expand the
Content heading and find the section for Web Content. You can click the
\emph{Change} button to select/deselect options to publish dealing with
your new Web Content instance.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/web-content-version-history-box.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.24: Click the \emph{Change} button and uncheck the
version history box to only publish the latest approved version of web
content articles that have multiple versions.}
\end{figure}

Liferay 6.2 also added a portal property,
\texttt{jour\-nal.pub\-lish.ver\-sion.hist\-o\-ry.\-by.de\-fault}, that sets the
default behavior. By default, this property is set to \texttt{true} so
site administrators have to manually uncheck the \emph{Version History}
box mentioned above if they only want to publish the latest approved
version of web content articles. If you'd like to change the default
behavior, add the following line to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties}
file:

\texttt{journal.publish.version.history.by.default=false}.

One of the most powerful features of staging is page variations. Let's
see how to use them to create multiple different variations of your
site's pages for different purposes.

\subsection{Using Site Pages
Variations}\label{using-site-pages-variations}

Let's say you're working on a product-oriented site where you'll have
several major changes to a page or a set of pages over a short period of
time. Also you need to be working on multiple versions of the site at
the same time to ensure everything has been properly reviewed before it
goes live. With staging in Liferay 6.2 you can do this using \emph{Page
Variations}.

For example, you can create several page variations, enabling the
marketing team to give your site a completely different look and feel
for Christmas. At the same time, the product management team can work on
a different version that will be published the day after Christmas for
the launching of a new product. Additionally, the product management
team is considering two different ideas for the home page of the site,
so they can create several page variations of the home page inside their
product launch site.

Variations only affect pages and not the content, which means all the
existing content in your staging site is shared by all your variations.
In different site page variations you can have different logos,
different look and feel for your pages, different applications on these
pages, different configuration of these applications and even different
pages. One page can exist in just one site page variation or in several
of them.

By default, we only have one site page variation which is called
\emph{Main Variation}. To create a new one, use the dropdown next to the
\emph{Staging} link and click on \emph{Manage Site Pages Variations}.
This brings you to a list of the existing site page variations for your
site. Click \emph{Add Site Pages Variation} to create a new one. From
the \emph{Add Site Pages Variation} screen, you can set a Name,
Description, and also set your new variation to copy the content from an
existing variation. There are several options to choose in this
selector.

\textbf{All Site Pages Variations:} creates a new variation that
contains the last version marked as ready for publication from any
single page existing in any other variation.

\textbf{None (Empty Site Pages Variation):} creates a new, empty
variation.

\textbf{Main Variation:} creates a new site page variation that contains
only the last version of all the pages that exist in this variation. The
current variation must be marked as ready for publication.

You are also able to rename any variation. For example, edit the Main
Variation and change its name to something that makes more sense in your
site, such as \emph{Basic}, \emph{Master}, \emph{Regular} and create a
variation for Christmas.

You can switch between different variations by clicking on them from the
staging menu bar. It's also possible to set permissions on each
variation, so certain users have access to manage some, but not all
variations.

You can now go to the home page of your Christmas variation and change
the logo, apply a new theme, move portlets around, change the order of
the pages and configure different portlets. The other variations won't
be affected. You can even delete existing pages or add new ones
(remember to \emph{Mark as Ready for Publication} when you are finished
with your changes).

When you delete a page, it is deleted only in the current variation. The
same happens when you add a new page. If you try to access a page which
was deleted in the current variation, Liferay informs you this page is
not \emph{enabled} in this variation and you must enable it. To enable
it, navigate to the \emph{Site Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Pages} →
\emph{Site Pages} screen. Here all the existing pages for all the
variations are shown in a tree. Pages not enabled for the current
variation are shown in a lighter color. You can also access Staging
options from the Site Pages screen by clicking the \emph{Staging}
drop-down menu located above the pages tree.

To publish a variation to the live site, click on \emph{Publish to Live}
$\rightarrow$\emph{Publish} in the dropdown next to the variation name.
Publications can also be scheduled independently for different
variations. For example, you could have a variation called
\emph{Mondays} which is published to the live site every Monday and
another one called \emph{Day 1} which is published to the live site
every first day of each month.

You can also have variations for a single page inside a site page
variation, which allows you to work in parallel in different versions of
a page. For example, you might work on two different proposals for the
design of the home page for the Christmas variation. These page
variations only exist inside a site Page variation.

To create a new page variation, click \emph{Manage Page Variations} on
the staging toolbar. This brings you to a list of existing page
variations for the current page (by default, there is only one called
\emph{Main Variation}). You can create more or rename the existing one.
You can switch between different page variations using the toolbar
containing the page variations below the site pages variations toolbar.
When you decide which page variation should be published, mark it as
\emph{Ready for Publication}. Only one page variation can be marked as
ready for publication and that is the one that gets published to the
live site.

For example, we could create a page variation called Thanksgiving for
the News and Events page inside of the Christmas variation and another
one called Christmas Day to display different content on those
particular days.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-branch-thanksgiving.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.25: This is an example of a Thanksgiving Page
Variation.}
\end{figure}

Another powerful feature is the possibility of \emph{merging} Site Pages
Variations. To merge two Site Pages Variations, you need to go to the
Manage Site Pages Variations screen. From there, click on \emph{Merge}
on the Site Pages Variation you want to use as the base. You will be
asked to choose the Site Pages Variation to merge on top of it. Merging
works in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  New pages that don't exist in the base Variation, will be added.
\item
  If a page exists in both Site Pages variations, and at least one
  version of the page was marked as ready for publication, then the
  latest version marked as ready will be added as a new Page Variation
  in the target page of the base Variation. (Note that older versions or
  page variations not marked as ready for publication won't be copied.
  However, merge can be executed as many times as needed and will create
  the needed pages variations in the appropriate page of the base Site
  Pages Variation).
\item
  Merging does not affect content nor will overwrite anything in the
  base Variation, it will just add more versions, pages and page
  variations as needed.
\end{itemize}

Let's finish our discussion of staging by outlining a few more features.

\subsection{Wrapping up Staging}\label{wrapping-up-staging}

You can enable staging on an individual site basis, depending on your
needs. This makes it easy to put strict controls in place for your
public web site, while opening things up for individual sites that don't
need such strict controls. Liferay's staging environment is extremely
easy to use and makes maintaining a content-rich web site a snap.

Let's examine teams next.

\section{Creating Teams for Advanced Site Membership
Management}\label{creating-teams-for-advanced-site-membership-management}

Teams allow site administrators a greater degree of flexibility than was
possible using just user groups and roles. They allow site
administrators to create various sets of users and permissions for
site-specific functions. Teams are the preferred method for collecting
permissions within a single site.

If you create a team for one site, the permissions defined for it are
not available to any other sites. In contrast, if you assigned a custom
role to a user group, the role would be available portal-wide even
though the specific permissions defined by it would only apply within
the scope of a designated site. Furthermore, team members, unlike user
group members, are guaranteed to be members of the desired site.

To create a team within a site, first navigate to the Site
Administration page of your site and select \emph{Users} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site
Teams}. It's important to note that configuring other site membership
groupings, such as \emph{Users}, \emph{Organizations}, and \emph{User
Groups} can be found in the \emph{Site Memberships} portlet, which is
also located in the Users tab. You can visit the \emph{Management}
chapter for more information on how these site memberships. Finally,
click the \emph{Add Team} button.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-creating-a-team.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.26: Creating teams within your site helps your users
demonstrate teamwork and collaboration.}
\end{figure}

After you've clicked the \emph{Add Team} button and entered a name and a
description, click \emph{Save}. Your new team will appear in the list.
To add members, simply click on \emph{Actions $\rightarrow$Assign Members}.

Permission management for teams is configured by navigating to
\emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Permissions} for your individual site. Setting
permissions for the team assigns every member of the team with equal
permissions. Only administrators with the ability to edit/manage the
team have the ability to manage team permissions.

That's it! Now your team is ready to perform their functions. Next,
let's look at how to configure Liferay for mobile devices.

\section{Displaying Site Pages to Mobile
Devices}\label{displaying-site-pages-to-mobile-devices}

Mobile device families allow you to configure sets of rules to alter the
behavior of the portal based on the device being used to access Liferay.
The proportion of mobile device users browsing the web has been steadily
increasing, so it's important to be able to handle different kinds of
devices appropriately. For instance, you can configure the look and feel
of Liferay pages accessed by smartphone or tablet users differently from
those accessed by PC users.

Both sites and individual pages can be configured with any number of
mobile device families. A family is designed to describe a group of
devices. It can contain one or more rules that describe a category of
devices, such as all Android devices or all iOS tablets. You can define
as many rules in a family as you need to classify all the devices for
which you'd like to define actions. Families can be prioritized to
determine which one applies to a given page request.

In order to configure mobile device rules, you need a way to find out
the characteristics of the device. While some of the characteristics are
provided by the device, most are not. For this reason, there are
databases that contain information about thousands of devices. These
databases make it possible to learn every detail about a device from the
device type, which is included in each request sent to the portal.
Liferay's Mobile Device Rules can connect to device databases so that
you can use their device characteristics in your rules.

Among the plugins available on Liferay Marketplace, you can find the
Device Recognition Provider plugin. This plugin provides out of the box
integration with WURFL, an open source database licensed with the AGPLv3
license. Commercial licenses are also available. It's also possible to
develop plugins that integrate with other device databases. Even if you
don't have a device database, you can still set up mobile device rules.
They won't, however, be effective until a database is deployed, because
the portal won't have enough information about the devices being used to
make page requests.

To configure mobile device rules, you must install the Device
Recognition Provider plugin. This plugin uses the WURFL database to
enable Liferay to detect which mobile device or operating system is
being used for any given request. To install the plugin, navigate to the
Store section of the Control Panel, located under the Marketplace
heading. Click on the \emph{Utility} section and then on \emph{See All}.
Search for the appropriate Device Recognition Provider plugin (CE or EE)
and click on it. Finally, click on \emph{Free} to acquire the plugin.
Once you've acquired the plugin, you need to download and install it. To
do so, navigate to the Purchased section of the Control Panel, find your
Device Recognition Provider plugin, and click on \emph{Download} and
then \emph{Install}.

\textbf{Installation Note:} If your server doesn't have access to the
outside Internet, an error appears in your log:

\begin{verbatim}
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder"
\end{verbatim}

This occurs because WURFL by default downloads device information from
the web. You can provide the same information to WURFL manually by
downloading the SLF4J distribution from
\url{http://www.slf4j.org/download.html}, unzipping the resulting file,
copying 

\begin{verbatim}
slf4j-log4j12-[version].jar} 
\end{verbatim}

to the 

\begin{verbatim}
WEB_APP_HOME/wurfl-web/WEB-INF/lib
\end{verbatim}

folder, and restarting your Liferay instance. On some application servers,
you'll need to add this .jar file to the \texttt{wurfl-web.war} file first (in
the directory noted above) before deploying the file to your server.

You can access the Mobile Device Families administrative page from the
Configuration section of Site Administration. Make sure you're on the
appropriate site before adding mobile device families via Site
Administration. You can also add families for all sites by navigating to
the Control Panel $\rightarrow$\emph{Sites} $\rightarrow$\emph{Global}. The Mobile Device
Families administrative page displays a list of defined families and
lets you add more. To add rules to a family, select \emph{Actions} →
\emph{Manage Classification Rules}, or click on a family to edit it, and
then click the \emph{Manage Classification Rules} link.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/mobile-device-families.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.27: You can manage device rules from the Mobile Device
Families administrative page.}
\end{figure}

The rules defined for a family, along with the priorities of the
families selected for a particular site or page, determine which
family's actions are applied to a given request. From the Manage
Classification Rules page for a specific rule set, you can add a rule by
specifying an operating system, rule type, physical screen size, and
screen resolution. Remember that you can add as many rules to a family
as you need in order to classify the devices on which you'd like to take
actions. You'll notice after saving the classification rule that it's
characterized as a \emph{Simple Rule}. By default, only the Simple Rule
type is available. The rules are designed to be extensible, and
additional rule types can be added by your developers.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/mobile-device-editing-rule.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.28: You need to install the Device Recognition
Provider plugin to populate the OS list.}
\end{figure}

Once you've created some mobile device families and added some rules to
them, you'll be ready to set up some actions. The actions defined for a
family determine what happens to a particular request when the device is
detected and the family has been found to apply.

You can add actions to a family from the Site Pages page of Site
Administration. Select either the public or private pages and then look
for the \emph{Mobile Device Rules} link in the right-hand menu. Use the
\emph{Select Device Family} button to select families to be applied
either to a site or to a single page. If you select the page group
itself from the left-hand menu, the selected family applies to all the
pages of the site by default. If, however, you select an individual page
and then click the \emph{Select Device Family} button, the families
apply only to that page. You can select multiple families for a
particular site or page and order them by priority. The families are
checked in decreasing order of priority: the actions defined by the
first family that applies are executed.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/mobile-device-selection.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.29: You can select a mobile device family to apply for
a site or page from the Site Pages section of Site Administration.}
\end{figure}

To add actions to a selected rule group, use the \emph{Actions} →
\emph{Manage Actions} button and then click \emph{Add Action}. By
default, there are four kinds of actions that can be configured for
mobile families: layout template modifications, theme modifications, URL
redirects, and site redirects. Layout template modifications let you
change the way portlets are arranged on pages delivered to mobile
devices, and themes modifications let you select a specific look and
feel. If it makes more sense for you to create separate mobile versions
of certain sites or pages, you can use a redirect to make sure mobile
device users get to the right page. To define a URL redirect, you need
to specify a URL. To define a site redirect, you need only specify the
site name and page name of the page to which you're redirecting. Like
mobile device rules, mobile device actions are designed to be
extensible. Your developers can define custom actions in addition to the
four actions provided by default.

To review, if you'd like to configure an action or actions that take
place when mobile device requests are received, take the following
steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Create a mobile device family to represent the group of devices for
  which to define an action or actions.
\item
  Define one or more rules for your family that describe the group of
  devices represented by your family.
\item
  Apply your family to an entire page set of a site (all the public
  pages of a site or all the private pages) or to a single page.
\item
  Define one or more actions for your family that describe how requests
  should be handled.
\end{enumerate}

To see how this might work in practice, let's discuss a few examples of
how you can use mobile device rules. First, suppose you have a separate
version of a site on your portal that's specifically designed for mobile
phones running Android or Bada. For our example, we'll make a site
called Android/Bada Liferay and we'll configure the default Liferay site
to redirect incoming requests from Android or Bada mobile phones to the
Android/Bada Liferay site. Our first step is to create the Android/Bada
Liferay site: go to the Sites page of the Control Panel and click
\emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Blank Site}. Enter the name \emph{Android/Bada
Liferay} and click \emph{Save}. Then, with Android/Bada selected in the
context menu selector, click on \emph{Site Pages}. By default, the newly
created site doesn't have any pages, so click on \emph{Add Page}, enter
the name \emph{Welcome}, and click the \emph{Add Page} button. Now our
Android/Bada Liferay site has a public Welcome page just like our
default Liferay site.

Next, select \emph{Liferay} in the \emph{My Sites} tab of the Dockbar,
navigate to Site Administration $\rightarrow$Configuration, and click on
\emph{Mobile Device Families}. Click on \emph{Add Device Family}, enter
the name \emph{Android and Bada Mobile Phones}, and click \emph{Save}.
You'll see the message, \emph{No rules are configured for this rule
group}.

Click the \emph{Manage Classification Rules} link and we'll configure
our rule group to apply only to mobile phones running Android or Bada.
Click \emph{Add Classification Rule}, enter \emph{Rule 1} for the name.
Under Operating System, select \emph{Android} and \emph{Bada OS} (hold
down Control to make multiple selections), select \emph{Other Devices}
under Tablet since we want our family to apply only to mobile phones,
and click \emph{Save}. Now we just need to define the redirect action
for our family. Navigate to \emph{Pages} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site Pages} and click
on \emph{Mobile Device Rules} in the navigation menu to the right.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/site-pages-mobile-device-rules.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.30: To apply a mobile device family to a page set of a
site, click on \emph{Mobile Device Rules}, click \emph{Select Device
Family}, and select the desired rule group.}
\end{figure}

Click \emph{Select Device Family} and then click the \emph{Android and
Bada Mobile Phones} device family that you configured. Once you've
selected your device family, click on your device family or
\emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Manage Actions} next to it. Then click \emph{Add
Action}, enter the name \emph{Android/Bada Liferay Redirect}, and select
\emph{Redirect to Site} under Type. Under the Site dropdown menu that
appears, select \emph{Android/Bada Liferay} and under the Page dropdown
menu that appears, select the \emph{Welcome} page that you created
earlier. Lastly, click \emph{Save}. That's it! Now Android and Bada
mobile phone users are redirected to the Android/Bada Liferay site from
the Liferay site.

Let's look at one more example of using mobile device rules before we
move on. Suppose you'd like to create another rule so that when a site
is accessed by an Android or iOS tablet, a different layout is used. To
set this up, we need to follow the same four steps described above.
First, make sure you're on the Liferay site by checking in the My Sites
tab of the Dockbar. Then navigate to the Mobile Device Families page of
Site Administration. Add a new device family called \emph{Android and
iOS Tablets}. Add a classification rule called \emph{Rule 1}, select
\emph{Android and iPhone OS} under the \emph{Operating System heading},
select \emph{Tablets} under the \emph{Device Type} heading, then click
\emph{Save}. As with the previous example, we only need one rule to
describe our device family.

Next, click on \emph{Site Pages} in Site Administration, select
\emph{Mobile Device Rules}, and select the \emph{Android and iOS
Tablets} device family. Notice that you've now selected two rule groups
for the Liferay site's public pages and they've been assigned
priorities. If a device making a request belongs to both of the device
families represented by the rule groups, the priority of the rule groups
determines which rule group's actions are executed. Note that in our
example, the first rule group contains only mobile phones and the second
rule group contains only tablets, so no devices can belong to both rule
groups. Now we just need to define an action for our Android and iOS
Tablets rule group to use a different layout: On the Site Pages page of
Site Administration, click on \emph{Mobile Device Rules}, and then on
\emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Manage Actions} next to Android and iOS Tablets.
Click on \emph{Add Action}, enter the name \emph{Layout Template
Modification}, and select the \emph{Layout Template Modification} action
type. Lastly, select the \emph{1 Column} layout template (or whichever
one you like) and click \emph{Save}. Good job! Now the Liferay site's
pages are presented to Android and iOS tablet users with the 1 Column
layout template.

\section{Liferay Monitoring using Google
Analytics}\label{liferay-monitoring-using-google-analytics}

Liferay includes built-in support for Google Analytics, allowing
administrators to make use of Google's tool set for analyzing site
traffic data. When you sign up for Google Analytics, a snippet of code
is provided which needs to be added to your web pages to allow Google's
system to register the page hit. It can be a tedious process to add this
code to every page on a site, especially if it's a large site and there
is a lot of user-generated content.

This problem can be solved in Liferay by putting Google's code into a
custom theme written specifically for the web site on which the portal
is running. Doing this, however, requires a theme developer to make
specific changes to the theme and it prevents users from using the many
themes that are freely available for Liferay ``out of the box.''

Because of this, support for Google Analytics has been built into
Liferay, and can be turned on through a simple user interface. This
allows Liferay administrators to make use of Google Analytics on a site
by site basis and turn it on and off when needed. You can sign up for
Google Analytics at the Google Analytics site here:
\url{http://www.google.com/analytics}.

To enable Google Analytics support, navigate to \emph{Site
Administration} in the Control Panel, expand the \emph{Configuration}
area in menu at the left side of the screen, then click on \emph{Site
Settings}. Click on \emph{Analytics} and you'll see a very simple form,
pictured below.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/maintaining-google-analytics.png}
\caption{\\Figure 3.31: Setting up Google Analytics for your site is very
easy: sign up for Google Analytics, receive an ID, and then enter it
into the Google Analytics ID field.}
\end{figure}

Enter your Google Analytics ID (which should have been provided to you
when you signed up for the service) in the field and click \emph{Save}.
All the pages in the site you selected will now have the Google
Analytics code in them and will be tracked.

This is a fairly simple procedure, and it gives you the ability to take
advantage of some great tools to help you visualize who's coming to your
site and from where.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-2}

This chapter has been your guide to advanced Liferay site management and
web content management. We've seen how you can use Liferay to manage
both simple content and advanced content with structures and templates.
We've also learned how to use page and site templates to simplify the
site creation process.

Liferay WCM also includes a powerful staging environment, allowing you
to stage content locally on the same server or remotely to another
server. You can publish your site when you want it, on the schedule you
choose. You can even create different variations of your site that can
be worked on simultaneously.

Site administrators can allow users to create personal customizations of
site pages. We discussed how site administrators can create teams as a
flexible means of delegating site permissions. We also saw how to
configure mobile device rules so that site pages are presented
differently depending on the device making a page request.

Whether your site is small and static or large and dynamic, Liferay's
WCM enables you to plan and manage it. With tools such as the WYSIWYG
editor, structures and templates, you can quickly add and edit content.
With the Web Content Display and Asset Publisher, you can rapidly select
and configure what content to display and how to display it. By using
Liferay's integrated workflow, you can set up custom publishing rules to
fit your organization. And by using Liferay's staging and scheduling
mechanisms, you can manage various branches of pages and content and
control when they are published to your live portal instance. You will
find that managing your site becomes far easier when using Liferay's Web
Content Management system.

\chapter{Configuring Liferay
Applications}\label{configuring-liferay-applications}

Just like siblings have common features inherited from their parents,
applications that ship with Liferay also share common features. These
include look and feel, communication, scoping, sharing, permissions,
archive configurations, exporting/importing portlet data, and the
Recycle Bin. We'll discuss how these features work together to
facilitate information flow within your portal and provide an enhanced
experience for your users. So before we get into the nitty gritty of the
applications themselves, it's best to cover these common features first,
starting with the look and feel configuration options.

\section{Look and Feel}\label{look-and-feel}

An administrator can access the look and feel configuration menu of any
Liferay portlet by clicking on the gear icon at the top right corner of
the portlet and selecting \emph{Look and Feel}. The location of the gear
icon may vary, depending on your theme. Liferay portlets' look and feel
dialog boxes contain six tabs:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Portlet Configuration
\item
  Text Styles
\item
  Background Styles
\item
  Border Styles
\item
  Margin and Padding
\item
  Advanced Styling
\end{itemize}

After making customizations on any tab, remember to click the
\emph{Save} button to apply your changes. To see the effect of your
changes, you may have to refresh the page. If you don't like the effect
of your changes, click the \emph{Reset} button to discard them.

On the Portlet Configuration tab, you can check the \emph{Use Custom
Title} box to rename your portlet's title. The value you enter in the
Portlet Title box will be displayed at the top of the portlet window on
the page. You can also select a language from the Portlet Title
drop-down menu. If you've provided a language key translation for the
language you select, the your portlet's title will be displayed in the
selected language.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/look-and-feel-portlet-configuration.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.1: The Portlet Configuration tab of the Look and Feel
Box allows you to define a custom portlet title, link portlet URLs to a
specific page, and select whether or not portlet borders should be
displayed.}
\end{figure}

If you select a page in the \emph{Link Portlet URLs to Page} drop-down
menu, all portlet URLs will point to the page you selected. The current
page is the default. Note that you can use the Asset Publisher's View in
a Specific Portlet feature and web content articles' Display Page
attribute to achieve a more elegant solution for displaying the full
view of web content articles on specific pages. Please see the Display
Page section of chapter 5 for details.

\textbf{Note:} The \emph{Link Portlet URLs to Page} menu is deprecated
for Liferay 6.2 and will be removed in Liferay 7.0. The functionality of
this menu can also be found in the Asset Publisher.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}
You can also choose whether or not to display borders around your
portlet. By default, borders are displayed. Be careful about turning
portlet borders off; some themes assume that portlet borders are turned
on and may not display correctly with them turned off.

The Text Styles tab allows you to configure format of the text that
appears in the portlet. The fonts you can choose from include Arial,
Georgia, Times New Roman, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, and Verdana. Arial is
the default. You can set the text to bold, italics, or both. You can set
the font size anywhere from 0.1 em to 12 em, with 0.1 em increments. 1
em is the default. You can set the text color to any six digit hex color
code. If you'd like help choosing a color, click on the text box to open
the color palette. You can set the text alignment to left, center,
right, or justified. (Justified text is both left and right aligned.)
You can set an underline, overline, or strikethrough as the text
decoration. The default text decoration is none.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\scalegraphics{../../images/look-and-feel-text-styles.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.2: The Text Styles tab lets you configure the format
of the text that appears in the portlet.}
\end{figure}

You can set the word spacing anywhere from -1 em to 0.95 em, with 0.5 em
increments. 0 em is the default. You can set the line height anywhere
from 0 em to 12 em, with 0.1 em increments. 0 em is the default.
Finally, you can set the letter spacing anywhere from -10 px to 50 px,
with 1 px increments. 0 px is the default.

The Background Styles tab allows you to specify the portlet's background
color. When you select the text space, you're given a color palette to
choose your background color or you can manually enter any six digit hex
color code.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/look-and-feel-background-styles.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.3: The Background Styles tab lets you specify the
portlet's background color.}
\end{figure}

On the Border Styles tab, you can configure your portlet's border width,
border style, and border color. For each of these attributes, leave the
\emph{Same for All} box checked to apply the same settings to top,
right, bottom, and left borders.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/look-and-feel-border-styles.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.4: The Border Styles tab lets you specify a border
width, style, and color for each side of the portlet.}
\end{figure}

For border width, you can specify any \% value, em value, or px value.
For border style, you can select dashed, double, dotted, groove, hidden,
inset, outset, ridge, or solid. For border color, you can enter any six
digit hex color code, just like for the text color and background color.
You can also use the color palette.

The Margin and Padding tab allows you to specify margin and padding
lengths for the edges of your portlet. Just like for border styles,
leave the \emph{Same for All} box checked to apply the same settings to
each side (top, right, bottom, and left) of the portlet.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/look-and-feel-margin-and-padding.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.5: The Margin and Padding tab allows you to specify
margin and padding lengths for the sides of your portlet.}
\end{figure}

For both padding and margin, you can specify any \% value, em value, or
px value.

The Advanced Styling tab displays current information about your
portlet, including your portlet's Liferay ID and CSS classes.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/look-and-feel-advanced-styling.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.6: The Advanced Styling tab displays your portlet's
Liferay ID and allows you to enter CSS code to customize the look and
feel of your portlet.}
\end{figure}

On this tab, you can also enter custom CSS class names for your portlet
and custom CSS code. Clicking the \emph{Add a CSS rule for just this
portlet} or \emph{Add a CSS rule for all portlets like this one} links
adds the CSS code shells into your custom CSS text box. If you check the
\emph{Update my styles as I type} box, your CSS code will be dynamically
applied to your portlet so you can see the effects of your edits.

For Liferay 6.2, the WAP Styling functionality has been deprecated.
Liferay Portal uses a new responsive design making WAP Styling
configuration unnecessary for your portlet's look and feel. You can
enable the WAP functionality for your portal's Look and Feel section by
opening/creating your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file in your
\texttt{\$\{LIFERAY\_HOME\}} directory and setting
\texttt{mobile.device.styling.wap.enabled=true}. WAP functionality will
be completely removed from Liferay in the next release.

Next, let's discuss exporting and importing portlet data.

\section{Export/Import}\label{exportimport}

Some Liferay portlets allow you to export or import portlet data. These
include many of Liferay's collaborative applications, such as the Blogs,
Wiki, and Message Boards portlets. To export or import portlet data,
click on the gear icon of your portlet and select \emph{Export/Import}.
Exporting portlet data produces a \texttt{.lar} file that you can save
and import into another portlet application of the same type. To import
portlet data, you must select a \texttt{.lar} file. Be careful not to
confuse portlet-specific \texttt{.lar} files with site-specific
\texttt{.lar} files. See the Backing up and Restoring Pages section of
chapter 2 for a discussion of exporting and importing data across an
entire site. Let's explore the export process first.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/portlet-export.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.7: When exporting portlet data, you can choose what
content to include.}
\end{figure}

First, you can select a \emph{Date Range} of content that you'd like to
export. Content that has been added to your portlet within your
specified date range is included in the \texttt{.lar} file. You also
have options of choosing \emph{All} dates or just the most recently
added content, or \emph{Last}.

Next, by checking the \emph{Content} box, you can choose specific
content you'd like to export. When you check the \emph{Content} box,
more options appear, allowing you to choose specific kinds of metadata
to include. For example, if you have a wiki page with referenced content
that you don't wish to include, you can simply check the \emph{Wiki
Pages} checkbox and uncheck the \emph{Referenced Content} checkbox.
Another option in the Content section of the Export/Import window is the
selection of content types. Two familiar content types in your portal is
\emph{Comments} and \emph{Ratings}. If you wish to include these
entities in your \texttt{.lar} file, select \emph{Change} and select
them from the checklist.

Lastly, you can choose whether to include permissions for your exported
content. The permissions assigned for the exported portlet window will
be included if the \emph{Permissions} option is checked. When you check
this box, a sub-box called \emph{Permissions Assigned to Roles} appears.
If you wish, you can export your portlet's permissions but not the
permissions assigned to roles. After you've exported your portlet's
data, switch to the \emph{Current and Previous} tab to view ongoing
export processes and the history of past exports.

To import portlet data, you can select the LAR using your file explorer
or by dragging and dropping the file between the dotted lines. After
selecting the LAR file, you're given a similar screen to what you'd be
offered during export. Select the appropriate content and permissions,
and click \emph{Continue}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/portlet-import.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.8: When importing portlet data, you can choose a LAR
file using the file explorer or drag and drop the file between the
dotted lines.}
\end{figure}

The next screen offers options split into two sections -- \emph{Update
Data} and \emph{Authorship of the Content}. Here's options and
descriptions for each section:

\textbf{Update Data}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{Mirror}: All data and content inside the imported LAR will be
  created as new the first time while maintaining a reference to the
  source. Subsequent imports from the same source will update entries
  instead of creating new entries.
\item
  \emph{Mirror with overwriting}: Same behavior as the mirror strategy,
  but if a document or an image with the same name is found, it is
  overwritten.
\item
  \emph{Copy as New}: All data and content inside the imported LAR will
  be created as new entries within the current site every time the LAR
  is imported.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Authorship of the Content}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{Use the Original Author}: Keep authorship of imported content
  whenever possible. Use the current user as author if the original one
  is not found.
\item
  \emph{Use the Current User as Author}: Assign the current user as the
  author of all imported content.
\end{itemize}

Next, let's discuss the concept of a portlet's scope.

\section{Scope}\label{scope}

As we learned earlier, roles can be scoped by the portal, by a site, or
by an organization. A role only takes effect within its scope. For
example, a Message Boards Administrator role with complete access to the
Message Boards portlet has different permissions based on the role's
scope. If it's a portal role, members have permission to administer
message boards across the entire portal. If it's a site role, members
only have permission to administer message boards within the site where
they've been assigned the role. For organizations with sites, site roles
are automatically assigned to organization members based on the
organization roles they have. So for an organization-scoped Message
Boards administrator role, members only have permission to administer
message boards within the site of the organization that assigned the
role to them.

We also use the word \emph{scope} to refer to the data set of a portlet.
By default, when a portlet is added to a page in a site, it is
\emph{scoped} for that site. This means that its data belongs to that
site. If the portlet is added to a page in a different site, it employs
a completely different data set. This enables you to place a Message
Boards portlet in one site with one set of categories and threads, and
place another Message Boards portlet in different site with a different
set of categories and threads.

Scoping by site means that you can only have one Message Boards portlet
per site. If you add one Message Boards portlet to a page in a site and
add another Message Boards portlet to a different page in the same site,
the second Message Boards portlet contains exactly the same data as the
first. This is because, by default, the Message Boards portlet is scoped
by site. Most of Liferay's other portlets also default to being scoped
by site.

To avoid this limitation, many Liferay portlets can be scoped by page.
In this case, the data sets of page-scoped portlets serve a single page,
not an entire site. If you set the scope of a portlet to \emph{page}
instead of \emph{site}, you can add any number of these portlets to
different pages, and then they have different sets of data. This allows
you to have more than one message board per site if you wish. Most
portlets, however, default to the ``native'' configuration, and have
their scopes set to the site where they are placed.

Unless otherwise noted, all the portlets in this chapter support scoping
by portal (global), site (default), or page . This grants you some
flexibility in how you want to set up your portal. You can configure the
scope of a portlet with just a few simple steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Click the \emph{Options} icon in the portlet window (the gear icon).
\item
  Select \emph{Configuration}.
\item
  Select the \emph{Scope} tab.
\item
  Use the drop-down menu to set the scope.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-changing-portlet-scope.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.9: You can change the scope of your portlet by
navigating to its Configuration menu.}
\end{figure}

That's all it takes to change the scope for a particular portlet
instance. By setting the scope to the current page, you can add as many
of these portlets to a site as you want, provided they are all added to
separate pages.

Another useful feature of Liferay's portlets is Archived Setups.

\section{Archived Setups}\label{archived-setups}

Once you've configured a portlet, Archived Setups enables you to save
those settings in an ``archive''. If someone goes in and changes the
settings of a particular portlet, it then becomes easy to revert those
changes back to the original, archived configuration.

To create an archived setup, click the \emph{Configuration} option from
the menu in the portlet's title bar. If the current settings of the
portlet you're configuring are the ones you want to archive, click the
\emph{Archive/Restore Setup} link. If not, change and save the settings
until you have the portlet configured the way you want it, and then
click the \emph{Archive/Restore Setup} link.

There is only one field to fill out. Enter a name for your archive and
click \emph{Save}. You should now see your archive in the list. If you
ever need to revert the portlet to these archived settings, you can
click \emph{Actions $\rightarrow$Restore} next to the archived setup you want to
restore.

Unless otherwise noted, all of the portlets in this chapter support this
feature. This is particularly useful for portlets that have a lot of
configuration options, such as the Message Boards portlet.

Next, we'll see how permissions apply to Liferay portlets in general.

\section{Permissions}\label{permissions}

All of Liferay's portlets support Liferay's robust, fine-grained
permissions system. Some higher level permissions can be configured in
the permissions tab of the portlet configuration dialog box. You can
grant roles permission to add the portlet to a page, configure the
portlet, or view the portlet. To set these permissions, go to the
\emph{Configuration} menu and click on \emph{Permissions}. This shows
you a table of roles defined in the portal. Use the check boxes to grant
certain permissions to different roles. Click \emph{Save} after you've
made your selections.

Beyond this, specific permissions are generally defined for specific
applications. For example, the message boards portlet contains a
\emph{Ban User} permission. This makes no sense in the context of
another portlet, say, the blogs portlet. We'll go over permissions for
specific applications in the sections for those applications. For now,
let's move on to sharing applications.

\section{Communication}\label{communication}

Liferay implements several communication mechanisms across portlets
including those specified by the JSR-286 standard: public render
parameters and events. Public render parameters are easy to use and can
be quite powerful. Some Liferay portlets provide a configuration UI to
help you get the most out of this communication mechanism. To access
this UI, open your portlet's configuration window by clicking on the
gear icon and selecting \emph{Configuration}. Then click on the
\emph{Communication} tab.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/portlet-communication-tab.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.10: You can configure portlets to communicate with
each other using public render parameters.}
\end{figure}

The screenshot above is for the Wiki portlet, which has six public
render parameters: categoryId, nodeId, nodeName, resetCur, tag, title.
For each of these parameters, you can configure the portlet to ignore
the values coming from other portlets to read the value from another
parameter.

Why might it be useful to ignore the values for certain parameters that
come from other portlets? Consider a common use case for the Wiki
portlet. The Wiki portlet is often used along with the Tags Navigation
portlet so that when a user clicks on a tag of the latter, the Wiki
portlet shows a list of pages with that tag. In some cases, an
administrator may want the Wiki portlet to always show the front page
independently of any tag navigation done through other portlets. This
can be achieved by checking the \emph{Ignore} checkbox so that the
values of the parameter coming from those other portlets are ignored.

Reading the value of a parameter from another portlet is an advanced but
very powerful option that allows portlets to communicate with each other
even if their developers didn't intend them to. For example, imagine
that the Wiki portlet is being used to publish information about certain
countries. Imagine further that there's another portlet that allows
browsing countries for administrative reasons. The second portlet has a
public render parameter called \emph{country} with the name of the
country. We'd like the Wiki to show the information from the country
that's selected in the administration portlet. This can be achieved by
setting the value of the title parameter of the Wiki portlet to be read
from the country parameter of the administration portlet. Cool, isn't
it?

\section{Sharing}\label{sharing}

The web was once thought of as a number of islands of applications in a
vast universe of ``cyberspace.'' Many web sites attempted to make their
island the biggest. Some succeeded to a large extent and some failed.
More recently, the concept of the web as an application itself has taken
hold, and so widgets have become very popular nowadays. This concept is
part of the ``Web 2.0'' concept and is very much enabled by widgets.
What is a widget? A widget is a small piece of code which provides a
piece of functionality, can be included on any web site, but does not
necessarily have to be hosted by that web site. If you have ever
embedded a YouTube video on your own web site so that users could watch
a video without actually having to visit
\href{http://youtube.com/}{http://youtube.com}, then you've already used
a widget.

Liferay supports serving its portlets as widgets. You can embed a
particular instance of a portlet running on your site into another site,
such as Facebook. This opens up a whole new avenue of exposure to your
web site that you would not have had otherwise. In fact, this is how all
those Facebook games work.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-collaboration-portlet-configuration-sharing.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.11: The Sharing tab of the Portlet Configuration
Dialog Box allows you to share your portlet in a variety of ways.}
\end{figure}

To share one of your portlets as a widget, open the \emph{Configuration}
dialog box from the portlet's title bar and select the \emph{Sharing}
tab. There are five sub-tabs under sharing: Any Web Site, Facebook,
OpenSocial Gadget, Netvibes, and Friends.

\subsection{Any Web Site}\label{any-web-site}

Copy and paste the provided snippet of JavaScript code into the web site
to which you want to add the portlet as a widget. That's all you need to
do. When a user loads the page on the other web site, the code will pull
the relevant portlet from your site and display it.

\subsection{Facebook}\label{facebook}

You can add any Liferay portlet as an application on Facebook. To do
this, you must first get a developer key. A link for doing this is
provided to you in the Facebook tab. You'll have to create the
application on Facebook and get the key and canvas page URL from
Facebook. Once you've done this, you can copy and paste their values
into the Facebook tab. Your portlet will now be available on Facebook as
a Facebook application.

Incidentally, this makes Liferay a fantastic platform upon which to
build applications for Facebook. See the \emph{Liferay Developer's
Guide} or \href{http://manning.com/sezov}{\emph{Liferay in Action}} for
more details.

\subsection{OpenSocial Gadget}\label{opensocial-gadget}

OpenSocial comprises a container and a set of APIs for social networking
and other web applications. iGoogle is a service provided by Google that
lets users create a customizable page and add \emph{Gadgets} to that
page. Liferay can serve up portlets to be used as Open Social Gadgets on
iGoogle or other OpenSocial-compatible pages.

To serve a Liferay portlet on iGoogle, check the box labeled \emph{Allow
users to add {[}portlet-name{]} to iGoogle}. Then copy and paste the URL
provided into Google's \emph{Add a feed or gadget} feature on the
iGoogle configuration page. Your Liferay portal instance will serve that
portlet directly onto your iGoogle page. The URL provided is unique to
the specific instance of the portlet, so you could serve multiple
instances of the same portlet as different Google Gadgets.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-liferay-forum-facebook.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.12: Liferay's Forums on Facebook is an example of
sharing the Message Boards portlet.}
\end{figure}

You could use this feature to allow users to view what's happening on
your portal at a glance, using asset publishers or custom RSS feeds. You
could also use Liferay's API to build your own portlet and provide the
URL for users to place on their iGoogle pages.

\subsubsection{Netvibes}\label{netvibes}

Netvibes offers a similar service to iGoogle--users can log in, create
their own personal portal, called a \emph{dashboard}, and add
customizable widgets to the dashboard that they create. To set up
Netvibes support for a particular portlet, check the \emph{Allow users
to add {[}portlet-name{]} to Netvibes pages} box. You can then use the
provided URL to create a custom Netvibes widget based on the instance of
the portlet that you're using.

\subsubsection{Friends}\label{friends}

The final sub-tab of the \emph{Sharing} tab is called \emph{Friends}.
This tab has a single check box that allows you to give your friends
permission to add the application as a widget to another web site. This
could be particularly useful for your blog or calendar if you wish to
share them.

Next, let's explore what the Recycle Bin does for your Liferay
applications.

\section{Recycling Assets with the Recycle
Bin}\label{recycling-assets-with-the-recycle-bin}

Have you ever had that life-altering experience where you deleted an
important file and immediately regretted deleting it? The deed is
usually followed by a palm to the forehead or a sick feeling. Good news!
Liferay is here to turn that frown upside down with the \emph{Recycle
Bin} feature. With the Recycle Bin, the \emph{Move to the Recycle Bin}
action replaces \emph{Delete} for certain asset types. Content is now
temporarily stored in the Recycle Bin. This allows the content to be
restored back to its original state. Recycled items can expire after a
certain period of time, resulting in their permanent deletion. Before
diving into how the Recycle Bin works, let's look at how to configure
it.

\subsection{Configuring the Recycle
Bin}\label{configuring-the-recycle-bin}

To begin using the Recycle Bin, you must enable it where you plan to use
it. The Recycle Bin supports portal-wide scope or site-specific scope.
The portal-wide scope of the Recycle Bin is set by adding the
\texttt{trash.enabled} property to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties}
file. We'll go into more detail for adding this property and several
others to your properties file later in the section. First, let's
explore the UI and see what the Recycle Bin can do.

First, let's configure the Recycle Bin for site-specific scoping. Choose
the site you'd like configure for the Recycle Bin from \emph{My Sites}
in the Dockbar. Then click \emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Configuration} to
navigate to the \emph{Site Settings} page. Next, click \emph{Recycle
Bin} on the right-side menu under the Advanced heading. You'll notice a
few configurable options:

\textbf{Enable Recycle Bin:} enable and disable settings for the Recycle
Bin's site-specific scope.

\textbf{Trash Entries Max Age:} customize the number of days a file is
kept in the Recycle Bin until its permanent deletion (default is 30
days).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/recycle-bin-site-settings.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.13: The Recycle Bin offers several configurable
options for your site.}
\end{figure}

When you've finished configuring your Recycle Bin settings, click
\emph{Save}.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} If you disable the Recycle Bin while it's still holding
recycled items, the recycled items reappear in the Recycle Bin if it is
re-enabled.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}

You can also configure the Recycle Bin via properties in the
\texttt{portal.properties} file. Remember that it's a best practice not
to edit the \texttt{portal.properties} directly, but to create a
separate \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file containing the properties
to override. There are some additional options not available in the GUI
that you can set:

\texttt{trash.search.limit=500}: set the limit for results used when
performing searches in the Recycle Bin (default is 500).

\texttt{trash.entry.check.interval=60}: set the interval in minutes for
how often the trash handler runs to delete trash entries that have been
in the Recycle Bin longer than the maximum age (default is 60).

Also, as we mentioned earlier, there is a property to enable the Recycle
bin portal-wide.

\texttt{trash.enabled=true}: set this property to true to enable the
Recycle Bin for all sites in the portal while allowing site
administrators to disable it per site.

Next, you should make sure permissions are set properly for users who
can handle/view the assets in the Recycle Bin. Users who had \emph{View}
permissions on a document when it was recycled can also view that
document in the Recycle Bin. Users who had \emph{Update} or
\emph{Delete} permissions on a document when it was recycled can restore
the document.

Now that you've successfully configured the Recycle Bin, let's look at
how to use it.

\subsection{Using the Recycle Bin}\label{using-the-recycle-bin}

The Recycle Bin is temporary storage configured for multiple asset types
across the portal. Instead of offering a specific Recycle Bin for each
asset type, Liferay provides a central master Recycle Bin where
different asset types can be stored. This provides an easy search and
recovery process.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/recycle-bin-overview.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.14: The Recycle Bin provides a seamless administrative
experience for deleting and removing content.}
\end{figure}

You can recycle several different types of assets, including:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Blogs
\item
  Bookmarks
\item
  Documents and Media
\item
  Message Boards (and attachments)
\item
  Web Content
\item
  Wiki (and attachments)
\end{itemize}

For a quick example to show how easy the Recycle Bin is to use, let's
send a web content article to the Recycle Bin and then restore it. We'll
run through two different methods of restoring the file.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Navigate to \emph{Site Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Content} $\rightarrow$\emph{Web
  Content}.
\item
  Select the \emph{Add} button and click \emph{Basic Web Content}.
\item
  Enter some text for the Title and Content and click \emph{Publish}.
\item
  In the top right corner of the web content, select the arrow and click
  \emph{Move to the Recycle Bin}.

  Note that the \emph{Delete} button is not listed. Liferay avoids the
  risk of accidental deletion of your files by funneling the content
  through the Recycle Bin.
\item
  After deleting the file, a success message appears, offering an
  \emph{Undo} option. Click \emph{Undo}. The web content is retrieved
  from the Recycle Bin and stored in its original place.
\item
  Select the \emph{Move to the Recycle Bin} button again.
\item
  Navigate back to Site Administration and click the Recycle Bin button
  from the menu.
\item
  Find your sample web content and click its \emph{Actions} tab.
\item
  You can restore or delete the content. Select \emph{Restore}.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/recycle-bin-restore.png}
  \caption{Figure 4.15: In the Recycle Bin, you have the option of
  restoring or permanently deleting the content.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Navigate back to the Web Content screen and notice that your sample
  web content was restored back to its original place.
\end{enumerate}

Congratulations! You now know the two general processes of sending and
restoring content to/from the Recycle Bin. For other asset types, the
Recycle Bin works similarly.

Some Liferay applications, such as Web Content and Documents and Media,
support folders into which their content can be organized. You can also
send folders and sub-folders to the Recycle Bin. Keep in mind that this
sends the entire folder/sub-folder structure and all files to the
Recycle Bin. Folders and sub-folders are restored and deleted the same
way as a single file. Also, expired web content can be moved to the
Recycle Bin and restored, just like a regular file.

In step 9 of the example, you probably noticed the \emph{Delete} button
from within the Recycle Bin. This is the permanent delete button. Once
you select this, your file cannot be retrieved and is gone forever.
There is also an \emph{Empty the Recycle Bin} button located at the top
of the Recycle Bin screen. This permanently deletes all the files from
the Recycle Bin. Next, let's discuss how to use the drag and drop
feature.

\subsubsection{Drag and Drop}\label{drag-and-drop}

A quick and easy way to dispose of your unwanted assets is to drag and
drop them into the Recycle Bin. While you're in the Control Panel, you
can simply select an asset and drag it to the Recycle Bin portlet
located on the Control Panel menu. When you click and begin dragging the
asset, a message appears near your cursor notifying you of the amount of
files ready to be moved, and the Recycle Bin is highlighted, showing you
where the files can be dropped. After you drop the asset onto the
Recycle Bin portlet, the asset is removed from its original location and
transferred to the Recycle Bin.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/recycle-bin-drag.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.16: A quick and easy way of disposing your items is
the drag and drop method.}
\end{figure}

Next, let's explore the Recycle Bin's intelligence and behind the scenes
support that aids in a seamless recycling experience.

\subsubsection{Recycle Bin intelligence and
support}\label{recycle-bin-intelligence-and-support}

Have you ever wondered if it's possible to check the IQ of a software
feature? Unfortunately, there is no tangible way to do this; however, if
there were, the Liferay Recycle Bin would be at the top of its class. As
we've mentioned already, it supports multiple asset types, a drag and
drop feature, an Undo option, and many more. Have you ever wondered what
happens to file shortcuts if their linked assets are recycled? What if
you restore a file that has the same name as another file currently
stored in your site/portal? The Recycle Bin already knows how to handle
these types of issues for a seamless user experience.

When documents with shortcuts are moved to the Recycle Bin, the
shortcuts are invalidated. This ensures your portal has active links and
shortcuts at all times. This cuts down on maintenance time and
backtracking after recycling an important asset.

Another important trait is the duplicate name recognition feature. When
a file is restored, the Recycle Bin scans the corresponding asset type
files currently in the site/portal to check for duplicate file names. If
a duplicate file name is found, the Recycle Bin prompts you to overwrite
the existing file or rename the file name you're trying to restore.

For example, suppose you have the document \texttt{file1} stored in the
Recycle Bin and you have a separate document you created later with the
same name in the document library. If you try to restore the
\texttt{file1} document, the Recycle Bin recognizes duplicate names and
prompts you to overwrite the existing document in the document library
or rename the document you're trying to restore.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/recycle-bin-duplicate-name.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.17: The Recycle Bin always scans your site/portal for
duplicate file names during the restoration process.}
\end{figure}

Although the Recycle Bin prohibits the restoration of files that match
pre-existing file names in your site/portal, it will store files with
matching names.

Have you thought about how the Recycle Bin works during the staging
process? Although we stated earlier that there is only one master
Recycle Bin, the staging process requires a bit more flexibility with
the Recycle Bin to maximize its productivity. Therefore, when staging is
enabled, there is a new and separate Recycle Bin: the \emph{Staging}
Recycle Bin. The original Recycle Bin, or \emph{Live} Recycle Bin,
holding unstaged material is still viewable while in staging; however,
it is never used.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/recycle-bin-staging.png}
\caption{\\Figure 4.18: During staging, a separate Recycle Bin appears to
keep staging and live content separate.}
\end{figure}

During staging, everything you recycle is sent to the Staging Recycle
Bin. This prevents staged and unstaged recycled content from mixing. Do
you see why this would be a problem? Consider you have an unstaged
document currently on your live site. Next, you enable staging and
delete that document. If you were to turn staging off and return to the
live site, without separate Recycle Bins, the live document would be
located on your site and in the Recycle Bin! Because of this, the
separate Staging Recycle Bin is necessary and only used during the
staging process. Finally, when you publish your staged material to live,
the Staging Recycle Bin content is transferred to the Live Recycle Bin.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} The Staging Recycle Bin saves its contents until the
staged material has been published to live. This means that you can turn
the staging mode on and off without losing your recycled material.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}
The Recycle Bin saves you time by letting you restore content that's
been recycled. Instead of recreating or re-uploading content, you'll be
tailoring your Liferay portal to fully leverage its capabilities.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-3}

In this chapter, we explored the configuration options available for
Liferay applications. We showed how to customize your applications,
export/import portlet data, take advantage of different scopes, and
communicate between portlets. We also examined the different uses of
social applications like Facebook and Netvibes for your Liferay
applications. Besides the general configuration options, we also
explored the Recycle Bin. This feature is a special file directory
allowing users to browse, retrieve, or permanently delete recycled
content. In all, Liferay gives you an abundance of options to leverage
the full capability of your applications.

\chapter{Document Management}\label{document-management}

Liferay's Documents and Media library provides a mechanism for storing
files online using the same type of structure that you use to store
files locally. You can use it to store files of any kind; it serves as a
virtual shared drive, and can mount and browse external repositories.
Its companion portlet, the Media Gallery, displays selected content from
the Documents and Media library. It can display image, audio and video
files. Other features in the Documents and Media library include
customizable document types and metadata sets, automatic document
preview generation, and support for mounting multiple external
repositories. The new document types and metadata sets are an addition
to, not a replacement for, the portal's system of tags and categories.
Let's start exploring how to use the Documents and Media portlet.

\section{Getting Started with the Documents and Media
Portlet}\label{getting-started-with-the-documents-and-media-portlet}

The Documents and Media portlet, like many other of Liferay's portlets,
is non-instanceable. This means that each page on your portal can host
at most one such portlet. Furthermore, if you add multiple Documents and
Media portlets to pages in the same site, these portlets by default
share the same data sets since they are scoped by site. However, you can
add multiple Documents and Media \emph{Display} portlets to a page. Then
you can choose specific subfolders from actual Documents and Media
repositories to display. Remember that users, by default, have their own
personal sites with public and private pages. They can use their
personal sites to host Documents and Media portlets for storing or
sharing their own files.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-document-library.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.1: The Documents and Media portlet offers a plethora
of options to choose from.}
\end{figure}

The Documents and Media portlet's default view displays the contents of
the \emph{Home} folder. The links on the left side of the portlet
windows are filters. You can use these filters to choose what you want
the main window of the portlet to show. \emph{Recent} displays documents
users have recently uploaded, edited or downloaded. \emph{Mine} shows
\emph{your} documents; in other words, the documents you have uploaded.
\emph{Browse by Type} shows a list of options you can choose to help
filter your results. If you click on one of these filters, the main
portlet window shows only documents that belong to the selected document
type. When you add custom document types, which we discuss below, they
are added to the filter list. Next, let's look at how to navigate around
Documents and Media.

\subsection{Navigating the Documents and Media
Portlet}\label{navigating-the-documents-and-media-portlet}

In the main window of the Documents and Media portlet, you can click on
a document to view details about it. Its version number, version
history, status, as well as who uploaded it and who last edited it.
Depending on the document, some automatically extracted metadata may
also be displayed, such as the document creator, author, title, content
type, creation date, and last modification date. In the case of audio or
video files, the duration would also be displayed. You can perform
several actions on the document here:

\textbf{Download:} lets you download the document.

\textbf{Get URL:} displays the URL of the document on the server.

\textbf{Get WebDAV URL:} displays the WebDAV URL of the document on the
server. Specify this URL as the file name when opening the document from
Microsoft Office.

\textbf{Edit:} lets you change contents of a document, point it to a
different file, change its title, description or document type, or add
tags, categories or related assets.

\textbf{Move:} lets you choose a new location in the Documents and Media
repository to store the document.

\textbf{Checkout/Checkin:} prevents others from modifying the document
while you are working. Other users can still view the current version of
the document if they have permission. You can check the document back in
when you're done working.

\textbf{Permissions:} allows you to configure file-specific permissions
for the document.

\textbf{Move to the Recycle Bin:} lets you remove the document from the
Documents and Media library.

If comments are enabled, you can also view comments, add comments, or
subscribe to comments about documents. Comments are enabled by default.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-doclib-document-view.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.2: You can click an asset in the Documents and Media
portlet to view its options and properties.}
\end{figure}

The menu at the top of the Documents and Media portlet contains Actions,
Add, Sort By and Manage buttons. There are also buttons for switching
between icon view, descriptive view, and list view. If there are lots of
documents in the Documents and Media library, the search field can help
you find the documents you're looking for. If your portlet contains more
documents than it can display at once, you can use the navigation tool
at the bottom of the portlet window to either switch your view to
another page or configure the page to display more documents per page.

When navigating among Documents and Media folders, look for the
\emph{Subscribe} link at the top right corner of the folder view.
Clicking the \emph{Subscribe} link subscribes you to the folder you're
currently viewing so that you'll receive email notifications. You'll be
notified about any actions that take place in the folder such as file
additions, edits, or deletions.

\subsubsection{Actions}\label{actions}

The Actions menu will only be displayed if you have selected one or more
documents with the check boxes.

\textbf{Cancel Checkout:} lets you check in a document that you had
checked out but did not make any changes to. Using this option will
prevent the Documents and Media portlet from incrementing the document's
version number and saving an identical version of the document.

\textbf{Checkin:} lets you check in a document that you have edited. Its
version number will increment and the previous version will be saved.

\textbf{Checkout:} lets you check out a document that you would like to
edit. This option prevents anyone else from modifying it while you are
working.

\textbf{Move:} allows you to choose a new location for a document or
folder within the portlet's file system. You can move multiple documents
and folders at the same time. Moving documents and folders is also
possible via drag \& drop.

\textbf{Move to the Recycle Bin:} allows you to remove a document or
folder from the portlet. You can move multiple documents and folders to
the Recycle Bin at the same time.

\subsubsection{Add}\label{add}

From the Add button, you can add documents, folders, and shortcuts just
like on your local file system.

\textbf{Folder:} lets you create a new location in your portlet's file
system.

\textbf{Shortcut:} allows you to create a shortcut to any document that
you have read access for. You can set permissions on the shortcut to
specify who can access the original document through the shortcut.

\textbf{Repository:} is a new feature of Liferay 6.1. This option allows
you to add an entirely new repository to your Documents and Media
portlet. To do this you need to specify the repository type and choose
an ID. If you are using the AtomPub protocol you'll also have to specify
the AtomPub URL.

\textbf{Multiple Documents:} allows you to upload several documents at
once.

\textbf{Basic Document:} allows you upload a single file that you would
like the default document type, ``Basic Document,'' to apply to. By
default, basic documents are not described by any metadata sets.

The remaining items in the Add menu are default document types that are
each described by a unique metadata set. When you add a document
belonging to a specific document type, you're presented with a form to
not only specify the file to upload but also to fill out the fields
defined by the document type's metadata set. We describe the
``Contract'' document type by way of example.

\textbf{Contract:} lets you upload a file that you would like the
``Contract'' document type to apply to. This document type is intended
to be used to describe legal contracts. By default, contracts are
described by effective date, expiration date, contract type, status,
legal reviewer, signing authority and deal name fields. Document types
are discussed below.

Any custom documents types that have been defined also appear in the Add
menu. If a document type has been created that matches the document you
would like to upload, you can select that document type from the Add
menu. This will associate the metadata fields associated with the
document type to your document and you will be asked to fill out the
fields.

Another useful feature for Liferay's Documents and Media portlet is the
drag-and-drop upload feature. Instead of manually uploading an asset via
the portlet's menu, you can select and drag an asset from your desktop
and drop it onto your portlet. You can also drag-and-drop folders full
of assets. When you drag the asset onto your browser, the Documents and
Media portlet is highlighted blue indicating its compatibility for the
drag-and-drop feature. When the asset is finally dropped on the
highlighted region, the asset is automatically uploaded and available
instantly.

Let's move on and discuss the Sort action.

\subsubsection{Sort}\label{sort}

You can sort the items displayed in the main window of the Documents and
Media portlet using the \emph{Sort By} menu. You can sort by title,
create date, modified date, downloads or size.

\textbf{Title:} lets you alphabetically sort documents by title.

\textbf{Create Date:} lets you sort documents by the time they were
created.

\textbf{Modified Date:} lets you sort documents by the last time they
were modified.

\textbf{Downloads:} lets you sort documents by the number of times they
were downloaded.

\textbf{Size:} lets you sort documents by how much disk space they use.

Let's dive into the Manage action next!

\subsubsection{Manage}\label{manage}

The Manage menu allows you to view the names of document types and
metadata sets, as well as the last times they were edited.

\textbf{Document Types:} shows you a list of defined document types.

\textbf{Metadata Sets:} shows you a list of defined metadata sets as
well as their portal IDs.

Now that we know the basic functionality of the Documents and Media
portlet, let's explore document types and metadata sets.

\section{Document Types and Metadata
Sets}\label{document-types-and-metadata-sets}

When a user assigns a document type to a document, the user is required
to fill out the fields defined by the metadata set of the document type.
This encourages users not to forget to enter important information about
their documents. For example, you could create a \emph{copyrighted}
document type and require users to enter a license for all
``copyrighted'' documents. More importantly, document types and metadata
sets can make it easier to find documents. The values that users enter
into the fields determined by their document type's metadata set become
searchable entities within the portal. You can use Liferay's search
portlet to search for these terms. Document types and metadata sets are
accessible from the \emph{Manage} button at the top of the Documents and
Media portlet window.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-document-types.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.3: Navigate to the Document Types Dialog Box by
clicking \emph{Manage} $\rightarrow$\emph{Document Types}.}
\end{figure}

You can add a new document type using the Add button at the top of the
dialog box. To do so, you need to define one or more metadata sets to
associate with your document type. When creating a new document type,
you can define \emph{Main Metadata Fields} or select \emph{Additional
Metadata Fields}. Main metadata fields are directly tied to their
document type and cannot be made available to other document types.
Additional metadata fields, by contrast, can be defined independently
and can be used in many different document types. You can differentiate
the document types that implement the same additional metadata set by
defining different main metadata fields for them. However, additional
metadata fields need to be defined and saved before creating a document
type that will implement them.

As an example, we could create a document type called \emph{Syllabus}
and define a metadata set. What metadata should we associate with
syllabi? Let's choose for our syllabi to have course title, professor,
semester, course description, and course requirements fields. All
syllabi in our portal should maintain entries for these fields. This
ensures that a syllabus shows up in a portal search if its course title,
professor or semester is searched for. Since we don't want to use our
metadata set for any document type other than \emph{Syllabus}, let's
create our metadata set under the Main Metadata Fields area.
Alternatively, we could create our metadata set independently using
\emph{Manage $\rightarrow$Metadata Sets $\rightarrow$Add} and then select it as an Additional
Metadata Field.

You can view, edit, or add metadata sets from the \emph{Manage →
Metadata} window. A metadata set consists of a group of fields. If you
click the \emph{Add} button, you can use same UI for defining a metadata
set that you used in the Add Document Type window.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-new-metadata-set.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.4: Adding a New Metadata Set is easier than ever with
Liferay's advanced editor.}
\end{figure}

Make sure the Fields tab is selected on the left. Then, to define a
metadata set, just choose fields to use from the area on the left and
drag and drop them into the area on the right. The drag and drop
interface allows for nested fields so you need to be careful about where
you drop the fields. Default values, mouse-over tips, widths, and other
settings can be configured for most fields. To configure these settings,
just click on a field from the area on the right. This automatically
selects the Settings tab on the left. Alternatively, you can access the
Settings tab by clicking the fields \emph{Settings} button (wrench).
Then double-click on a value to edit. Liferay supports the following
kinds of fields for metadata sets:

\textbf{Boolean:} is a checkbox.

\textbf{Date:} lets you enter a date. A valid date format is required
for the date field, but you don't have to enter a date manually. When
you select the date field a mini-calendar pops up which you can use to
select a date.

\textbf{Decimal:} lets you enter a decimal number. The value will be
persisted as a double.

\textbf{Documents and Media:} lets you select a file from one of the
portal's Documents and Media libraries.

\textbf{HTML:} an area that uses a WYSIWYG editor to enhance the
content.

\textbf{Integer:} lets you enter an integer. The value will be persisted
as an int.

\textbf{Link to Page:} lets you link to another page in the same site.

\textbf{Number:} lets you enter a decimal number or an integer. The
value will be persisted either as a double or an int, depending on the
type of input.

\textbf{Radio:} displays several clickable options. The default number
is three but this is customizable. Only one option can be selected at a
time.

\textbf{Select:} is just like the radio field except that the options
are hidden and have to be accessed from a drop-down menu.

\textbf{Text:} lets you enter a single line of text.

\textbf{Text Box:} is just like the text field except you can enter
multiple lines of text or separate paragraphs.

Remember that metadata sets created independently are reusable. Once
they have been created they can be included in any number of document
types as additional metadata sets. Next, let's take a look at tags. Tags
can be attached to most forms of web content that can be created in
Liferay, including documents.

\section{Alternative File Repository
Options}\label{alternative-file-repository-options}

By default, Liferay stores documents and media files on the file system
of the server on which it's running. You can choose a specific location
for the document library store's root directory by adding the following
property to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file and replacing the
default path with your custom path:

\begin{verbatim}
dl.store.file.system.root.dir=${liferay.home}/data/document_library
\end{verbatim}

You can also use an entirely different method for storing documents and
media files. You can use any of the following documents and media
library stores with Liferay:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Advanced File System Store
\item
  CMIS Store (Content Management Interoperability Services)
\item
  DBStore (Database Storage)
\item
  File System Store
\item
  JCRStore (Java Content Repository)
\item
  S3Store (Amazon Simple Storage)
\end{itemize}

For example, you can store documents and media files in your Liferay
instance's database using DBStore. To enable DStore, add the following
line to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
dl.store.impl=com.liferay.portlet.documentlibrary.store.DBStore
\end{verbatim}

Remember to restart your Liferay server after updating your
\texttt{por\-tal\--ext.pro\-per\-ties} file in order for your customizations to
take effect. Please refer to the Document Library Portlet section of
your \texttt{portal.properties} file to find a complete list of
supported customizations. You can customize features such as the maximum
allowed size of documents and media files, the list of allowed file
extensions, which types of files should be indexed, etc.

\section{Using External Repositories}\label{using-external-repositories}

Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) is a specification
for improving interoperability between Enterprise Content Management
systems. Documents and Media allows users to connect to multiple
third-party repositories that support CMIS 1.0 with AtomPub and Web
Services protocols.

Some of the features supported with third-party repositories include:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Reading/writing documents and folders
\item
  Document check-in, check-out, and undo check-out
\item
  Downloading documents
\item
  Moving folders and documents within the repository
\item
  Getting revision history
\item
  Reverting to revision
\end{itemize}

There are some subtle differences in setting up the different kinds of
third-party repositories for use in Documents and Media. But there are
plenty of similarities too.

Common Liferay configuration steps:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Adjust the portal properties.
\item
  Add any user accounts required by the repository.
\item
  Add the repository.
\end{itemize}

Lastly, keep in mind your third-party repository may require
installation and deployment of an appropriate Liferay plugin. Plugins
for SharePoint and Documentum are available through Liferay's
Marketplace.

Let's go through those steps, starting with setting our portal
properties.

\subsection{Adjusting portal
properties}\label{adjusting-portal-properties}

The admin must ensure that the same credentials and authentication are
being used in Liferay and in the external repository. This is normally
synchronized using a mechanism like LDAP. If you don't have LDAP, you
need to ensure manually that the credentials and authentication are the
same. In order to authenticate with the third-party repository, you need
to store passwords for the user sessions. Set the following portal
property in your \texttt{portal-ext.properties}:

\begin{verbatim}
session.store.password=true
\end{verbatim}

Next, we need to make sure the login and password for Liferay are the
same as the external repository. This is easily accomplished by using
identical screen names, so in \texttt{portal-ext.properties} add the
following:

\begin{verbatim}
company.security.auth.type=screenName
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively, configure these properties in the Control Panel under
\emph{Portal Settings} $\rightarrow$ \emph{Authentication}.

\subsection{Adding required repository
users}\label{adding-required-repository-users}

Once these properties are set, you must create a user in Liferay with a
screen name and password matching the administrative user of your
external repository. Be sure to assign appropriate roles
(e.g.~Administrator) to that user. Sign out of Liferay and sign in again
as that new user. See sections of the \emph{Management} chapter on
adding and managing users.

\subsection{Adding the repository}\label{adding-the-repository}

You can add new repositories from the UI by clicking the \emph{Add}
button from the Home folder. Repositories can only be mounted in the
Home folder.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-new-repository.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.5: You can add a new repository by navigating to
\emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Repository} in the Documents and Media portlet.}
\end{figure}

All fields in this form are required, except for \emph{Repository ID}.
Leave this field blank, and a repository ID is automatically generated
by the system. When finished, the repository is displayed on the left
side of the window in the Home folder.

Using this information, we can now add an example repository. As noted
previously, there are several repositories that work well with Liferay
using CMIS. One that is familiar to many users is SharePoint. In the
exercise below, we'll set up SharePoint as a Documents and Media
repository.

\subsection{Example Repository Setup:
SharePoint}\label{example-repository-setup-sharepoint}

With Liferay Portal you can connect to an external SharePoint server and
add it as a Documents and Media repository. This lets users collaborate
and share documents more easily between both environments. We will mount
a SharePoint repository via CMIS AtomPub and SharePoint SOAP web
services.

Liferay uses a combination of SOAP and Representational State Transfer
(REST), based on the Atom convention, to connect to the SharePoint
repository. SharePoint provides various SOAP services for modifying and
querying data from its document library. Liferay uses Axis2 to generate
SOAP calls to the SharePoint server.

To use SharePoint as a Liferay Documents and Media repository, we'll do
the following:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Configure the CMIS Connector on SharePoint.
\item
  Activate a SharePoint site as a CMIS Producer.
\item
  Acquire your SharePoint document library's repository ID.
\item
  Enable Basic Authentication on the SharePoint host.
\item
  Add SharePoint as a Liferay Documents and Media repository.
\end{itemize}

Note that this section is geared towards portal system administrators
and SharePoint system administrators.

Before you can use SharePoint as an external repository with Liferay
portal, you must verify that SharePoint is properly configured. Several
services must be set up on the SharePoint server before synchronizing
with Liferay.

\subsubsection{Configuring the CMIS Connector on
SharePoint}\label{configuring-the-cmis-connector-on-sharepoint}

SharePoint utilizes a CMIS Connector and a CMIS Producer to interface
with Liferay Portal. The Connector is installed with the SharePoint
Administrator Toolkit using a solution package called a Windows
SharePoint file (.wsp). If you don't have it already, install the
SharePoint Administrator Toolkit for its CMIS Connector. Install and
deploy the CMIS Connector as a Farm Solution on SharePoint.

The folder
\texttt{Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) Con\-nectors}
contains the \texttt{spscmis.wsp} file. Choose the appropriate
deployment settings and deploy that file. When deployment completes,
Solution Properties shows the solution is successfully deployed to all
target sites. Now it's time to configure the CMIS Producer.

\subsubsection{Activating a SharePoint site as a CMIS
Producer}\label{activating-a-sharepoint-site-as-a-cmis-producer}

The Producer makes SharePoint repositories available through the CMIS
Connector. All you have to do is choose the SharePoint site containing the
document libraries to be used as document repositories. Every document library
in this site is made available as a repository through the CMIS connector.

Go to \emph{Site Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site Settings} $\rightarrow$\emph{Manage Site
Features}. Enable the \emph{Content Management Interoperability Services
(CMIS) Producer} by clicking \emph{Activate}.

Now any document library created under this site is CMIS enabled. Before
we leave our SharePoint console, let's take note of our SharePoint
document library's repository ID.

\subsubsection{Acquiring the SharePoint document library's repository
ID}\label{acquiring-the-sharepoint-document-librarys-repository-id}

Acquiring your SharePoint document library's repository ID, or list ID,
is important as it must be specified in the AtomPub URL Liferay uses to
connect with the external repository. Finding it, however, can be a
little confusing. The easiest way to find the repository ID is by
accessing the SharePoint repository using a browser such as Mozilla
Firefox.

Follow these steps to get the repository ID:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In SharePoint, open the desired library.
\item
  Under Library Tools select \emph{Library}.
\item
  Click on \emph{Library Settings}, located to the far right.
\item
  The browser window refreshes displaying the repository ID between
  curly braces `\{' and `\}' in the browser's address bar.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/05-sharepoint-list-id.png}
  \caption{Figure 5.6: The repository ID can be found by displaying the
  repository's URL in a Firefox browser.}
  \end{figure}

  The repository ID is highlighted in the figure above. For this
  example, the repository ID is
  \texttt{6DFDA9-B547-4D1D-BF85-976863CDF533}. Therefore, the AtomPub
  URL you'd use when adding this repository in Documents and Media would
  resemble this:

\begin{verbatim}
http://liferay-20jf4ic/CMIS/_vti_bin/cmis/rest/6DFDA9-B547-4D1D-BF85-976863CDF533? \ 
getRepositoryInfo.
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

Be sure to copy down this URL so you can use it to configure SharePoint
as a repository in Documents and Media. Next, let's enable Basic
Authentication on the SharePoint host.

\subsubsection{Enabling Basic Authentication on the SharePoint
host}\label{enabling-basic-authentication-on-the-sharepoint-host}

For the CMIS connector and producer to work, Basic Authentication on IIS
must be enabled. This lets Liferay's SharePoint hook authenticate
against the SharePoint web services. Enable Basic Authentication on your
SharePoint host.

You are now prepared to mount SharePoint as an external repository.

\subsubsection{Adding SharePoint as a Liferay Documents and Media
repository}\label{adding-sharepoint-as-a-liferay-documents-and-media-repository}

With the SharePoint server configured, we now turn our attention to
Liferay. As mentioned in the common steps for adding an external
repository, be sure to adjust the portal properties and add any user
accounts required by the repository.

Here are the steps specific to configuring Liferay to use SharePoint:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Download and install the
  \href{https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/15188537}{SharePoint
  Connector EE} hook from Marketplace. See the
  \href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/downloading-and-installing-apps}{Downloading
  and Installing Apps} section of the \emph{Leveraging the Liferay
  Marketplace} chapter of this document for more information.
\item
  Add the Documents and Media portlet to a page, if you haven't done so
  already.
\item
  In the Documents and Media portlet click \emph{Add Repository} and
  enter the following information:

  \textbf{Name:} Enter an arbitrary name for the repository.

  \textbf{Description:} Describe the repository.

  \textbf{Repository Type:} Select \emph{SharePoint (AtomPub)}.

  \textbf{AtomPub URL:} Enter the applicable URL using the format below,
  substituting the SharePoint server's host name for \emph{{[}host{]}}
  and the SharePoint document library's repository ID for
  \emph{{[}repository ID{]}}:

\begin{verbatim}
http://[host]/CMIS/_vti_bin/cmis/rest/[repository ID]?getRepositoryInfo
\end{verbatim}

  \textbf{Repository ID:} Leave this field empty. Liferay searches for
  the first repository using the given parameters and sets this value to
  that repository's ID.

  \textbf{Site Path:} Enter data using the format below, the SharePoint
  server's host information for \emph{{[}host{]}} and the SharePoint
  document library's repository name for \emph{{[}repository path{]}}:

\begin{verbatim}
http://[host]/[repository path]
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Click \emph{Save}.
\end{enumerate}

The left navigation panel of your Documents and Media portlet now lists
your new repository.

\clearpage

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} In the site path example below, notice how the repository
path has a folder \texttt{Shared Documents} consisting of two words.

\begin{verbatim}
    http://liferay-20jf4ic/CMIS/Shared Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx
\end{verbatim}

The space between the words in the repository name must be accounted for
when setting the site path in Liferay. Replace the empty space with the
string \emph{\%20} so the site path value now looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    http://liferay-20jf4ic/CMIS/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx
\end{verbatim}

This should be done for any multi-word repository name.

\end{roundedframe}
Remember that connecting to an external SharePoint server and adding it
as a Documents and Media repository is a great way to give users
flexibility for sharing and collaborating on Microsoft Office documents.

Now let's look at configuring the Documents and Media portlet.

\section{Configuring the Documents and Media
portlet}\label{configuring-the-documents-and-media-portlet}

To configure the Documents and Media portlet, click on the gear icon at
the top of the portlet window and select \emph{Configuration}. The
portlet-specific customizations appear on the Setup tab. To change your
Documents and Media portlet's top-level folder, click \emph{Select}
below \emph{Root Folder}, browse or create the folder you'd like to be
your new top-level folder, and click \emph{Save}. The root folder is the
highest-level folder that's accessible from the Documents and Media
portlet. For example, suppose you created a folder called \emph{My
Documents} in the Documents and Media portlet's default Home folder. If
you set the My Documents folder to be your portlet's new root folder,
the original Home folder would no longer be accessible.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/docs-and-media-portlet-config.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.7: To make portlet-specific configurations for
Documents and Media, click on the gear icon at the top of the portlet
window and select \emph{Configuration}.}
\end{figure}

By default, the Documents and Media portlet contains a search bar to
help users quickly find relevant files. If you'd like the search bar not
to appear, uncheck the \emph{Show Search} box. The \emph{Maximum Entries
to Display} dropdown menu lets you set a limit on how many folders and
files can be displayed in the portlet window at once. By default, the
Documents and Media portlet contains three display style views: Icon,
List, and Descriptive. Icons for each appear in the portlet window,
allowing users to select the display style with which they're most
comfortable. Under the Display Style Views heading, you can select which
display styles users are able to choose and you can arrange the order of
the selected display styles. The topmost display style in the list
becomes the portlet's default display style.

Related assets are enabled by default for Documents and Media files.
Related assets allow users to link assets together even if the assets
don't share any tags or categories. To disable related assets for files
in your Documents and Media portlet, uncheck the \emph{Enable Related
Assets} box. For more information on related assets, see the section on
defining content relationships in chapter 6.

Under the Show Columns heading, you can customize which columns appear
when your Documents and Media portlet uses the list display style. By
default, file names, sizes, statuses, downloads, and actions are
displayed. You can also configure the portlet to display files' create
dates and modified dates. To add or remove columns from being displayed,
move them to the Current box or to the Available box. You can arrange
the columns in the Current box to control the order in which the columns
appear in the portlet: the topmost column in the box appears as the
leftmost column in the portlet.

Ratings and comment ratings are also enabled by default for Documents
and Media files. If users decide that a file or certain comment about a
file is useful or informative, they can rate it as good by clicking on
the thumbs up icon next to the rating. If they think the file or comment
is unhelpful or misleading, they can click on the thumbs down icon. If
you'd like to disable ratings or comment ratings for files, uncheck the
\emph{Enable Ratings} or \emph{Enable Comment Ratings} box,
respectively.

\section{Automatic Previews and
metadata}\label{automatic-previews-and-metadata}

Whenever possible, Liferay 6.2 generates previews of documents added to
the Documents and Media library. Out of the box, Liferay only ships with
Java-based APIs to generate previews for documents. The only tool
available that is 100\% Java and has a compatible license to be
distributed with Liferay is PDFBox. If you upload a PDF file to the
Documents and Media portlet, Liferay generates a preview for the PDF in
a separate thread. This process may last only a few seconds for a small
file. The larger the file, the longer it takes.

The first time you run a conversion like this, look for the following
console message:

\begin{verbatim}
Liferay is not configured to use ImageMagick for generating Document Library
previews and will default to PDFBox. For better quality previews, install
ImageMagick and enable it in portal-ext.properties.
\end{verbatim}

While a default implementation of image generation for document previews
and thumbnails is provided via PDFBox, you'll need to install and
configure some additional tools to harness the full power of Liferay's
Documents and Media library. These tools include
\href{http://www.openoffice.org}{\emph{OpenOffice}} or
\href{http://www.libreoffice.org}{\emph{LibreOffice}},
\href{http://www.imagemagick.org}{\emph{ImageMagick}}, which requires
\href{http://www.ghostscript.com}{\emph{Ghostscript}}, and
\href{http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler}{\emph{Xuggler}}. With these tools
installed and configured, Documents and Media content is displayed using
a customized viewer depending on the type of content. Configuring
Liferay to use OpenOffice or LibreOffice in server mode allows you to
generate thumbnails and previews for supported file types (.pdf, .docx,
.odt, .ppt, .odp, etc.), lets you view documents in your browser, and
lets you convert documents. ImageMagick allows for faster and
higher-quality previews and conversions. Xuggler allows for audio and
video previews, lets you play audio and video files in your browser, and
extracts thumbnails from video files. Please see the \emph{External
Services} section of chapter 17 for how to configure Liferay to use
these tools.

With the above tools installed and enabled, the Documents and Media
library looks like this:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-doc-previews.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.8: After configuring additional tools, previews in the
Documents and Media portlet are more advanced.}
\end{figure}

You can view a document with a customized viewer that allows you to
navigate through the different pages of the document and read its
content. In addition, you can view a multimedia document (audio or
video) and play it online. If the browser supports HTML5, it uses the
native player of the browser. Otherwise it falls back to a Flash player.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-document-preview.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.9: You can watch a video clip or even view a slideshow
inside Liferay's Documents and Media portlet.}
\end{figure}

Document previews are powerful and help users browse media more
successfully to find what they're looking for.

\subsection{Automatic extraction of RAW
Metadata}\label{automatic-extraction-of-raw-metadata}

When adding new documents or viewing existing documents, a process is
triggered automatically that extracts the file's metadata. The library
used by this process is TIKA and it's already included in Liferay out of
the box.

You can see the metadata when viewing the document, in the right side of
the window.

\subsection{Document type restrictions and workflow per
folder}\label{document-type-restrictions-and-workflow-per-folder}

You can force users to add only certain document types to a folder. By
default, child folders inherit the restrictions of their parent folder.
You can change this behavior by editing the folder and selecting the
allowed document types.

If workflow is enabled, you can specify different workflow definitions
per folder. Furthermore, you can specify different workflow definitions
per document type and per folder. You can set this by editing the
folder. Then the UI will look like this:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-document-type-workflow-restriction.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.10: Restrict Marketing folder to use specific document
types and workflow}
\end{figure}

Document types are a powerful way to enforce rules for documents
uploaded by users. Next, we'll see a way to make it incredibly easy for
users to access documents stored in Liferay's Documents and Media
repositories.

\subsection{WebDAV access}\label{webdav-access}

Wouldn't it be great if you could access documents and folders belonging
to Liferay's Documents and Media library from your own machine's file
manager? You can, thanks to the Documents and Media library's WebDAV
integration. WebDAV stands for Web-based Distributed Authoring and
Versioning. It's a set of methods based on HTTP that allows users to
create, edit, move, or delete files stored on web servers. WebDAV is
supported by most major operating systems and desktop environments,
including Linux (both KDE and GNOME), Mac OS, and Windows.

Suppose you've created an \emph{Image Gallery} folder using a Documents
and Media portlet and uploaded some images to it. Portal users with the
appropriate permissions can access this folder, and the image files it
contains, using a browser and Liferay's web interface. WebDAV provides
an alternative way to do this using a file manager instead of a web
browser. To access a folder stored in a Documents and Media portlet on a
remote server, you'll need log in credentials for the portal and the
WebDAV URL of the folder you'd like to access.

Next, navigate to the Documents and Media portlet hosting the folder
you'd like to access. Mouse over the folder (\emph{Image Gallery} for
our example) and select \emph{Access from Desktop}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/webdav-access-from-desktop.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.11: Select \emph{Access from Desktop} to get the
WebDAV URL of a folder.}
\end{figure}

Copy the WebDAV URL. On Windows, right-click on \emph{Computer} and
select \emph{Map Network Drive}. Select an unused drive, paste the
WebDAV URL, and click \emph{Finish}. You're prompted to enter your
Liferay credentials and then, provided you have the required
permissions, the \emph{Image Gallery} folder appears. You can now add,
edit, move, or delete files in this directory.

On Mac OS X, select \emph{Go} $\rightarrow$\emph{Connect to Server} in Finder. Then
enter the WebDAV URL of the folder you'd like to access in the Server
Address field, click \emph{Connect} and you should be prompted for your
Liferay credentials.

On Linux, you must slightly modify the WebDAV URL of your folder in your
file manager. For KDE's Dolphin, change the URL's protocol so that it
says \texttt{webdav://} instead of \texttt{http://}. For GNOME's
Nautilus, change the URL's protocol so that it says \texttt{dav://}
instead of \texttt{http://}. Then press \emph{Enter} and you're prompted
for your Liferay credentials.

Note that Liferay increments the version numbers of files edited and
uploaded via WebDAV so you don't have to worry that using your file
manager will bypass the functionality of Liferay's web interface. The
Documents and Media application is a powerful way to manage any types of
files your users need to use. Next, let's look at how you can leverage
Liferay Portal's Asset framework.

Now you know just how easy it is to store your files using Liferay's
Documents and Media portlet. In the next section, we'll review some ways
to organize and manage your assets so you're getting the most out of
your content.

\section{Liferay Sync}\label{liferay-sync}

Liferay Sync is an add-on product for Liferay 6.1 GA2 CE and EE, and
later versions, that synchronizes files between your Liferay server and
users' desktop and mobile environments. With Liferay Sync, your users
can publish and access shared documents and files from their native
environments without using a browser. Windows and Mac OS desktops and
Android and iOS-based mobile platforms are currently supported, while
Linux users have an unsupported beta they can use. As users add and
collaborate on documents and files, Liferay Sync automatically
synchronizes them across all configured Sync clients. Liferay Sync is
fully integrated into the Liferay Platform so that features such as
authentication, versioning, and social collaboration function in the
supported environments. Liferay Sync stores files locally so that
they're always available, even when you're offline. It automatically
synchronizes your files upon reconnection.

\subsection{How does it work?}\label{how-does-it-work}

Liferay Sync manages documents and site information through Liferay's
built-in web services. Clients securely communicate to Liferay using
user-supplied credentials such that each users can only access those
documents and sites for which they have permission. Changes made through
Liferay Sync are immediately available to the rest of the Liferay
Platform, including users accessing Liferay through traditional
web-based interfaces.

For desktop environments, a new folder structure is created and used for
synchronizing files. Files found therein can be treated as any ordinary
file. Credentials, sync frequency, and other options can be configured
in-client. Native desktop notification events keep you abreast of what
Sync is doing, and native menu and taskbar integration keep Sync
controls within easy reach.

Mobile environments are naturally dependent on the way in which
documents are handled. For Android and iOS, documents are maintained in
a file list, and can be viewed by clicking on the files themselves.
External files accessible from other apps can be ``opened'' using
Liferay Sync, thereby dropping them into your Sync folder and
synchronizing them across other Sync clients. In iOS devices, ``pulling
down'' on the Sync file list forces a refresh. In Android, click on the
\emph{Refresh} icon within the menu.

Liferay Sync is designed to work with both Liferay 6.1 GA2 CE and EE,
and later versions. Using Sync with Liferay CE limits users to syncing
one site. Using Sync with Liferay EE enables users to synchronize
documents and files across all the sites they can access.

Liferay Sync is also designed to work with Liferay Social Office. You
can sync one site from Social Office CE as well as one site from Liferay
Portal CE. If you've installed Social Office CE on Liferay Portal EE,
then you can sync any site from Portal, but only one from Social Office.
If you've installed Social Office EE on Liferay Portal EE, then you can
sync any and all sites.

\subsection{Installing Liferay Sync}\label{installing-liferay-sync}

For Windows or Mac OS, visit the Liferay Sync product page
\href{http://www.liferay.com/products/liferay-sync/features}{Liferay
Sync Product Page}, and click \emph{Get it Now} (on the right-side
navigation menu) to download the client application for your desktop
environment. For Windows, the client application installer should be
named
\texttt{life\-ray-sync-[ver\-sion]-[date].exe}.
For Mac OS, it should be
\texttt{life\-ray-sync-[ver\-sion]-[date].dmg}.
There is also a Linux beta version available. Follow the on-screen
instructions of the installer wizard to configure your client to connect
to an existing Liferay 6.2 deployment using your Liferay credentials.

Prior to Liferay 6.2, Liferay Portal's Documents and Media services
contained all the logic used by Liferay Sync. As of Liferay 6.2, Sync
processing has been removed from the portal and been placed in a plugin.
Make sure that the Sync plugin has been installed on your Liferay server
before trying to connect to your portal via a Liferay Sync client. The
Sync plugin's name is \emph{sync-web} and is installed by default in
Liferay Portal bundles. The Sync plugin is also available on Liferay
Marketplace and can be downloaded and installed on your Liferay server
just like any other Marketplace app. To find the app on Marketplace,
search for \emph{Sync CE} or \emph{Sync EE}, depending on your portal
version. To receive new features, optimizations, and bug fixes, make
sure to the update your Sync app whenever a new version is available.

\subsubsection{Windows}\label{windows}

Upon launching the Windows application installer, you'll be prompted to
choose an installation location for Liferay Sync. Browse to an
appropriate location on your machine and click \emph{Install}. After the
installation is complete, you'll need to complete the Liferay Sync
setup. Leave the \emph{Run Liferay Sync} button checked to automatically
start Liferay Sync after you click \emph{Finish}.

The first time you run Liferay Sync, you'll have to enter some account
information. Sync needs to know where you'd like to locally store the
files it's supposed to sync with your Liferay server. And, of course, it
needs to know your server's URL and the account credentials with which
it should authenticate.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-sync-new-account-info.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.12: The first time you run Liferay Sync, you'll have
to tell it how to communicate with your Liferay server.}
\end{figure}

The options for the Mac OS application installer are similar.

\subsubsection{Mac OS}\label{mac-os}

Liferay Sync for Mac is packaged in a DMG file. Double-clicking on a DMG
mounts it as a disk image, and opens a window showing the contents of
the image. To install Sync, drag the Liferay Sync icon to the
Applications folder. Once it's installed, go to your Applications folder
to run it.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-sync-mac-install.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.13: Drag the Liferay Sync icon to the Applications
folder.}
\end{figure}

When you launch Liferay Sync, the first thing you need to do is provide
it with the URL for the Liferay server that you'll be using Sync with,
along with your Liferay credentials. After that, you'll need to run
through the brief setup process that was described above for Windows.

Once you've finished your configuration and have clicked \emph{OK},
Liferay Sync starts running in the background, and an icon appears in
your top menu bar. If you wish to change any of your settings, click the
icon to open the Liferay Sync menu and click on \emph{Preferences}. Note
that on Windows, the Sync menu says \emph{Properties}, not
\emph{Preferences}.

\subsubsection{Mobile}\label{mobile}

For iOS, visit the App Store, search for Liferay, and install the
Liferay Sync App.

For Android, go to Google Play, search for Liferay, and install the
Liferay Sync App.

Once the mobile apps are installed, follow the on-screen instructions as
below.

\subsection{Using Liferay Sync on the
Desktop}\label{using-liferay-sync-on-the-desktop}

Once installed, you'll see a Liferay Sync icon in your taskbar whenever
it's running. A green checkmark means Liferay Sync has a working
connection to your Liferay server and is updating the files in your Sync
folder according to the interval you specified in the wizard. Click the
Liferay Sync icon in your taskbar to bring up the menu. The options
availabe from the menu are listed below:

\emph{Open Sync Folder} opens your Liferay Sync folder in your native
file manager.

\emph{Open Website} provides links to the pages containing the Documents
and Media portlets which you have permission to access. By default, you
can find links to your personal Documents and Media repository as well
as links to the Documents and Media repositories of all the other sites
you belong to.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Note for administrators: If you don't have a Documents and Media portlet
anywhere on a site that's been selected for syncing, you'll have to add
the portlet. Otherwise, users will get a \emph{The requested resource
was not found} error when they try to use the \emph{Open Website} link
from their Sync menus.

\end{roundedframe}
\emph{Recent Files} shows a list of recently created or modified files
from all the repositories you can access.

\emph{Properties} (\emph{Preferences}, on Mac OS) lets you change
properties like starting on login, desktop notifications, and sync
frequency. It also allows you to edit the account information you
provided when you started Sync for the first time. For example, you can
enter a new URL for your Liferay server and enter a different set of
Liferay credentials.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-sync-properties.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.14: Open the Liferay Sync menu and select
\emph{Properties} (\emph{Preferences}, on Mac OS) to edit the settings
you configured during setup.}
\end{figure}

There are three items listed in the \emph{General Settings} section.
\emph{Start Liferay Sync on Login} is checked by default. If you don't
want Sync to start automatically, uncheck this. \emph{Show Desktop
Notifications} is also checked by default. Unless you uncheck this, when
a file that you have synced is changed, a small notification will appear
in the corner of your screen. The \emph{Check Server For Updates Every:}
field enables you to set how frequently it will check to see if anything
has changed. This can be set anywhere between 5 seconds and 30 minutes.

Click the \emph{Edit Settings} button in the \emph{Account Settings}
section to specify your server's URL and enter your Liferay credentials.
Use the \emph{Test Connection} button to make sure Liferay Sync can
communicate with the server. Editing your settings also allows you to
specify your Sync folder, the folder where Sync will store files on your
machine. By default, files are stored in the \emph{liferay-sync}
subfolder of your personal Documents folder.

Finally, the \emph{Site Settings} section allows you to choose which
sites you wish to sync media from. By default, it will list all of the
sites that you are a member of, but you can uncheck any of those sites
if you don't want to sync those files.

\emph{About} displays Liferay Sync version information, copyright
information, and a link to Liferay's home page.

\emph{Check for Updates} checks to see if a new version of Liferay Sync
is available from \href{http://liferay.com}{life\-ray.com} and allows you to set whether or not
Liferay Sync should automatically check for updates.

\subsubsection{Using your Sync folder}\label{using-your-sync-folder}

Once Liferay Sync has been configured and is running, any files you add
to or modify in your Sync folder are automatically detected and uploaded
to your Liferay server. Also, changes from other users are downloaded to
your Sync folder.

If you delete a file your sync folder, it will only be deleted locally.
It will not be deleted on the server. This mechanism prevents users from
accidentally deleting shared files. When you delete a file from you Sync
folder, Sync will no longer download changes to this file the next time
it syncs. If you want to go back to syncing a file, simply restore it
from you recycle bin or trash can. Once the file is restored back to the
Sync folder, Sync keeps that file in sync by uploading any of your
changes and downloading any changes from the server.

You can run through the following exercise to familiarize yourself with
how to create, edit, download, and upload files with Liferay Sync.
First, open your Liferay Sync folder in your file manager (use the
\emph{Open Sync Folder} option of the Liferay Sync menu from the
taskbar), and create a new file called \texttt{README.txt}. Edit this
file and enter the word \emph{test}. Next, check that you can access
this file from your Liferay site. Open your browser, navigate to your
Liferay site, and sign in with your Liferay account credentials. First,
make sure that that you're on the site you want to sync with. Then
navigate to \emph{Site Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Documents and Media}. You
should see your \texttt{README.txt} file listed there.

Download the file (click the small triangle icon at the top right corner
of the \emph{README.txt} icon and select \emph{Download}) to a
convenient location on your machine and check that it still says
\emph{test}. Now open the \texttt{README.txt} file in your Sync folder
and edit it so that it says \emph{second test}. Once the changes are
synced go back to your browser and refresh your Documents and Media
page. Click on the \emph{README.txt} icon, look at the information
displayed to the right, and you'll see that its version number has
incremented.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-sync-README.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.15: Updating a file through Liferay Sync increments
the file's version number. You can view a file's version number through
the web interface.}
\end{figure}

You'll see that it now says \emph{second test}--your edit was uploaded
to the server. You can be confident that this edit was also downloaded
by all other Liferay Sync clients connected to your site.

\subsubsection{Demonstrating Liferay Sync
Permissions}\label{demonstrating-liferay-sync-permissions}

Liferay Sync uses the default Liferay permissions to determine which
files and folders are synced to the user's machine. This means that
whatever files a user can access from a certain site are the ones that
will be pulled down by Liferay Sync if that site is selected in the Sync
client. You can test the functionality of Liferay Sync permissions by
performing the following steps. First, create a new file on your desktop
called \emph{secret.txt}. Enter the text \emph{classified information}
into this file. Then use your browser to log into Liferay and create a
new user called \emph{secretagent} with the email address
\emph{secretagent@liferay.com} and the password \emph{test}. Also,
create a new private site called \emph{Secret Site}. Then assign the
\emph{secretagent} user to the \emph{Secret Site} and grant the
\emph{Site Administrator} role to this user. There will be no other
members of this site unless they are assigned by an administrator. Log
in as the \emph{secretagent} and select \emph{Secret Site} from the
\emph{My Sites} tab on the Dockbar. Then click on \emph{Documents and
Media} and upload the \emph{secret.txt} document.

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.4\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/liferay-sync-android-settings.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.16: Click the wrench icon to access your Liferay
server credentials.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Next, we'll configure our Liferay Sync client to log in with the
\emph{secretagent} user's credentials and access the \emph{Secret Site}.
Open the Liferay Sync menu from the taskbar and select
\emph{Properties}. Click on the \emph{Edit Settings} button, choose a
new Sync folder, enter your server's URL, and enter the secret agent's
credentials: \emph{secretagent@liferay.com} and \emph{test}. Lastly,
un\-check all Liferay sites except the \emph{Secret Site}, and click
\emph{OK}. Confirm that the \emph{secret.txt} file that you uploaded to
the \emph{Secret Site}, is downloaded to your new Sync folder. Open it
and check that it says \emph{classified information}. If you reconfigure
your Sync client connect to your Liferay instance using the credentials
of another user who doesn't belong to the \emph{Secret Site}, the
\emph{secret.txt} will not be downloaded. Congratulations! You've
successfully set up a Liferay Sync folder that can only be accessed by
the \emph{secretagent} user and your administrators.

\subsection{Using Liferay Sync Mobile}\label{using-liferay-sync-mobile}

Once you've installed Liferay Sync on your Android or iOS mobile
environment, you'll be able to access the same functionality that's
available when using Sync on a desktop environment. However, the
interface differs from that of the Sync desktop clients. Let's discuss
the usage of Liferay Sync Mobile for Android first.

\clearpage

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/liferay-sync-android-sites.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.17: Sites}
\end{wrapfigure}
\subsubsection{Android}\label{android}

After installing Liferay Sync for Android, an empty screen appears
asking you to set up the app. This screen appears whenever preferences
are missing. Touch the screen and it displays the \emph{Settings} view.
You can always go back to \emph{Settings} by clicking on the wrench icon
at the top right corner of the screen.

Enter your Liferay server credentials by filling in your \emph{Login},
\emph{Password}, and \emph{Server} information. Your \emph{Login} is
either your user account's email address or screen name. Use the same
credentials you use to log in to the portal in a browser. In the
\emph{Server} field, enter your portal's URL. In this example, the
server URL is \emph{http://www.liferay.com}. Click the key icon on the
top right to test your connection and check if everything is correct.

Note for Gingerbread users: If you can't see some of the features
described here, click on the menu button to view a list of all possible
actions. This includes options to refresh, open the settings menu,
upload files, take photos, test your connection, etc. After you have
successfully tested your connection, hit the \emph{back} button and
you'll see a list of Liferay sites you have access to.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/liferay-sync-android-details.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.18: Liferay Sync's details view offers several
options.}
\vspace{-20pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

You can browse the files of a site by tapping on any of them. This opens
a list of the folders and files belonging to the site that you have
permission to view. From here, you can click on a folder and browse
deeper into the folder hierarchy or click the \emph{Back} button to
navigate back to parent folders up to the initial \emph{Sites} list.

Single-tap on a file to open it. If the file has never been downloaded
before, Sync will download it and open after it has finished
downloading. You can only view the file's contents if your device has an
app installed that can open the file type. For example, in order to open
a PDF, you must have at least one PDF viewer app installed. Otherwise,
you will see a message informing you that no viewer is available and you
need to install an app that can open the file.

Long-press on any folder or file to find a list of actions you can take
on it: \emph{Add to Favorites}, \emph{View Details}, \emph{Download},
\emph{Rename} or \emph{Delete}. This actions menu varies depending on
which entry type is selected: file or folder.

On Gingerbread, the actions menu appears in the middle of the screen. On
Ice Cream Sandwich and above, you can find the action icons and menu at
the top right.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/liferay-sync-android-more.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.19: More options are available by selecting the three
dots button.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Clicking on \emph{Add to Favorites} (Gingerbread) or the gray star (Ice
Cream Sandwich) adds the selected file to the \emph{Favorites} list.
\emph{Favorites} are special files that can be accessed and viewed even
when you are offline (more details below). If a file is already marked
as a favorite, you'll see a \emph{Remove from Favorites} or blue star
instead. Clicking on it removes the selected file from the
\emph{Favorites} list.

Clicking on \emph{View Details} (Gingerbread) or the round icon with the
letter ``i'' (Ice Cream Sandwich) opens the details view, which displays
the entry's metadata such as creation date, author, version,
description, etc.

If you click on \emph{Download} (floppy disk icon on Ice Cream
Sandwich), it downloads and overwrites the local file copy.

You can rename a folder or file by clicking on the \emph{Rename} option.
This renames the entry in the portal.

Clicking on \emph{Delete} deletes the file/folder from the remote
portal, and other users won't be able to view or download it. On Ice
Cream Sandwich and above, you can select multiple entries for deletion.

Some actions are not related to a specific folder or file. You can find
these actions in the menu on the top action bar when no entry is
selected (Gingerbread users need to click on the device menu button).
Depending on the device screen width, some icons may overflow to the
three dots button on the right. Click on this button to see all of the
available actions.

The \emph{Refresh} button fetches and updates the list of folders and
files that have been changed in the portal.

The \emph{Camera} button allows you to quickly take a picture and upload
the image to the current folder. The image file name is automatically
generated with a time stamp.

The \emph{New Folder} button asks you for the name of the folder you
want to create in the portal.

The \emph{Upload} button displays the types of local files you can
upload to the portal. Choosing \emph{Image}, for example, shows all
images that are stored locally on your device. Once you choose the files
and confirm, these files are uploaded to the portal and are placed in
the current folder. By default, you can upload images, videos, and audio
files. If you have installed an app on your device that can open and
browse any type of file, you will also see an option called \emph{Other
files}.

The \emph{Favorites} menu option opens the favorites list. All files
that have been marked as favorites show up in this list. You should mark
your most important files as favorites because, as mentioned earlier,
the \emph{Favorites} feature gives you quick offline access to them. You
can view the contents of items in the \emph{Favorites} list, view their
metadata and, of course, remove them from the list.

Next, let's look at the iOS Sync app.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/liferay-sync-ios-files-list.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.20: Liferay Sync offers a folder and files menu.}
\vspace{-14pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

\subsubsection{iOS}\label{ios}

After installing Liferay Sync for iOS, an empty screen appears asking
you to set up the app. This screen appears whenever preferences are
missing.

Click on \emph{Settings} in the toolbar and enter your Liferay server
credentials by filling in your \emph{Login}, \emph{Password}, and
\emph{Server} information. Your \emph{Login} is either your user
account's email address or screen name, whichever you use to log in to
the portal in a browser. In the \emph{Server} field, enter your portal's
URL. In this example, the server URL is \emph{http://www.liferay.com}.
Click on \emph{Test Connection} to check if your configuration is
correct.

After you have successfully tested your connection, tap on the
\emph{Documents} toolbar section and you'll see a list of Liferay sites
you have access to. You can browse the files of a site by tapping on its
name or icon. This opens a list of the folders and files belonging to
the site that you have permission to view.

From here, you can click on a folder to browse deeper into the folder
hierarchy. You can also click on the \emph{Back} button to navigate back
to parent folders up to the initial \emph{Sites} list.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/liferay-sync-ios-open.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.21: Local files are stored after they are downloaded.}
\vspace{-45pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

You can refresh the list by pushing it down. This updates all the files
and folders that have been changed in the portal.

When you click on a file, this file is downloaded from the remote portal
and, if a previewer for this file type is available, you can view the
contents of the file. The next time you open a file, it won't download
it again; instead, it opens the local copy.

There are 3 icons at the bottom of the screen when you open a file:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Round icon with the letter ``i'' opens the details view, which
  displays the entry's metadata such as creation date, author, version,
  description, etc.
\item
  Star icon at the center adds the selected file to the \emph{Favorites}
  list. \emph{Favorites} are special files that can be accessed and
  viewed even when you are offline (more details below). If a file has
  already been marked as a favorite, clicking on the star icon removes
  the file from the \emph{Favorites} list.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/liferay-sync-ios-edit.png}
\caption{\\Figure 5.22: Edit mode is a key feature in Liferay Sync
mobile.}
\end{wrapfigure}

\item
  Share icon displays sharing options. You can, for example, send the
  file as an email attachment, print the file, or copy it to your
  clipboard. Some external apps may also appear in this list. For
  example, you can share your file with social apps and messengers if
  they are available.
\end{itemize}

In the file list, there's an Edit button. Clicking on it switches the
app to the edit mode as shown below:

Selecting one or more files or folders and clicking on the \emph{Delete}
button deletes the selected files or folders from the remote portal.
Once you delete files or folders from the remote portal, other users
won't be able to view or download them.

Selecting only one file or folder enables the \emph{Rename} button.
Click on it to change the entry's name locally and remotely.

To quickly delete a file or folder from the portal, you can also swipe
right and click on the \emph{Delete} button in the file list view.

If you want to upload an image or video to the portal, click the
\emph{Plus} button at the top right corner. You should see three
options:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Take a photo or video} opens your camera app and lets you take a
  photo or record a video and upload it.
\item
  \emph{Choose Existing} allows you to upload multiple photos or videos
  stored on your device.
\item
  \emph{Create New Folder} lets you type the name of the folder and
  creates it in the portal.
\end{itemize}

The \emph{Favorites} toolbar section opens the favorites list. All files
that have been marked as favorites show up in this list. You should mark
your most important files as favorites because, as mentioned earlier,
the \emph{Favorites} feature gives you quick offline access to them. You
can view the contents of items in the \emph{Favorites} list, view their
metadata and, of course, remove them from the list.

All downloaded files are stored on your device indefinitely. If you want
to delete downloaded files locally but don't want to remove them from
the portal, go to \emph{Settings} and click on the \emph{Clear Cache}
button.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-4}

In this chapter, we examined Liferay's Documents and Media Library, a
powerful and customizable virtual shared drive. Liferay 6.1 introduced
the ability to mount multiple external repositories to the Documents and
Media library. The Documents and Media library can be used to store
files of any kind. The Documents and Media Display portlet is meant to
be configured to show chosen hierarchies of folders and files from the
Documents and Media library. The Media Gallery is meant for presenting
media files such as images or videos.

Document types and metadata sets provide a flexible way to distinguish
between different types of files and to define custom metadata fields
for them. Document previews are automatically generated by default, but
Liferay supports integration with external tools that offer greater
speed, higher quality, and additional functionality. Finally, we
discussed Liferay Sync, an add-on product for Liferay 6.1 that allows
your Liferay server to directly synchronize files on users' desktop and
mobile environments.

\chapter{Displaying Content
Dynamically}\label{displaying-content-dynamically}

Any type of content in Liferay is considered an asset. In chapters 2 and
3, we examined Liferay's most common type of asset: web content. Other
types of assets include blog posts, wiki articles, message board posts,
bookmarks, and documents. It's possible for developers to define custom
asset types that utilize Liferay's asset framework. Originally, the
asset framework was created to provide a mechanism for adding tags to
blog entries, wiki articles, and web content without reimplementing the
same functionality multiple times. The asset framework has been greatly
extended since then and it now supports tags, categories, vocabularies,
comments, ratings, and asset relationships.

This chapter covers the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Tagging and categorizing content
\item
  Using targeted, single value, and multi-value vocabularies
\item
  Using faceted search
\item
  Using the Asset Publisher
\item
  Setting up display pages
\item
  Adding relationships between assets
\end{itemize}

The Asset Publisher portlet is designed to display multiple assets. It
has quite a few configuration options which we'll cover in this chapter.
By default, abstracts (previews) of recently published assets are
displayed by the Asset Publisher portlet and links to their full views
are provided. You can configure the Asset Publisher portlet to display a
table of assets, a list of asset titles, or the full content of assets.
You can also configure the Asset Publisher to display only certain kinds
of assets and you choose how many items to display in a list. The Asset
Publisher portlet is very useful for displaying chosen types of content,
for displaying recent content, and for allowing users to browse content
by tags and categories. The Asset Publisher is designed to integrate
with the Tags Navigation and Categories Navigation portlets to allow
this.

\section{Tagging and Categorizing
Content}\label{tagging-and-categorizing-content}

Tags and categories are two important tools you can use to help organize
information on your portal. These tools help users to easily find the
content they're looking for through search or navigation. Tagging and
categorizing assets is easy. You can tag or categorize an asset at
creation time or when editing an existing asset. If you click on the
\emph{Categorization} section of the form for creating or editing an
asset, you'll find an interface for adding tags and categories. If no
categories are available to be added to the asset (e.g., if no
categories have been created), the Categories heading won't appear.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-categorization.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.1: Here, the Web Content Display portlet's form for
categorizing a new web content instance doesn't include a Categories
heading since no categories have been created.}
\end{figure}

The Control Panel contains an interface for managing tags and categories
for each site in the portal. This interface can be used to manage all
your tags and categories in one place. It is important that you both tag
and categorize your content when you enter it. Let's take a closer look
at tags and categories.

\subsection{Tags}\label{tags}

Tags are an important tool that can help organize information on your
portal and make it easier for users to find the content that they're
interested in. Tags are words or phrases that you can attach to any
content on the website. Tagging content makes your search results more
accurate and enables you to use tools like the Asset Publisher to
display content in an organized fashion on a web page. There are two
ways to create tags: you can do it through the administrative console in
the Control Panel or on the fly as content is created. By default, tags
can be created by regular users and users can apply them to any assets
which they have permission to create or edit.

While regular users can, by default, create new tags by applying them to
any assets that they have permission to create or edit, only site
administrators can access the \emph{Tags} portlet in the Content section
of the Site Administration area of the Control Panel. Here, site
administrators can create new tags and edit any existing site tags. To
create tags in the Control Panel, visit the site for which you want to
create tags and then click on \emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Content}. Then click
on \emph{Tags} in the Content section on the left. From this screen, you
can view existing tags and create new ones. To create a new tag, click
\emph{Add Tag} and enter a name for the tag.

You can also customize a tag's permissions and properties. This
configuration, however, must be done by a server administrator. To
implement this configuration, add a \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file
to your Liferay Home directory with the following contents and then
restart the server:

\begin{verbatim}
asset.tag.permissions.enabled=true
asset.tag.properties.enabled=true
\end{verbatim}

Once this is done, you can change the permissions on a tag to make it
viewable by guests, site members, or owner. You can also assign other
permissions for managing tags, including permission to delete the tag,
edit the tag, or edit the tag's permissions. You can also add properties
to a tag. Properties are a way to add information to specific tags. You
can think of tag properties as tags for your tags. Structurally, tag
properties are key-value pairs associated with specific tags that
provide information about the tags.

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/05-add-tag.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.2: The Add Tag interface with editing of tag
properties and permissions enabled. When managing a site's content,
click on \emph{Tags} and then \emph{Add Tag} to create a new tag. The
Add Tag interface allows you to enter a name for the tag, define
permissions for the tag, and add properties to the tag.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Tags are not the only portal-wide mechanism for describing content: you
can also use categories.

\subsection{Categories}\label{categories}

Categories are similar in concept to tags, but are designed for use by
administrators, not regular users. Hierarchies of categories can be
created, and categories can be grouped together in \emph{vocabularies}.
While tags represent an ad hoc method for users to group content
together, categories exist to allow administrators to organize content
in a more official, hierarchical structure. You can think of tags like
the index of a book and categories like its table of contents. Both
serve the same purpose: to help users find the information they seek.

Adding vocabularies and categories is similar to adding tags. Visit the
site for which you want to create categories and then click on
\emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Content}. Then click on \emph{Categories} in the
Content section on the left to view the categories administration
portlet.

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/add-category.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.3: When managing a site's content, click on
\emph{Categories} and then on \emph{Add Vocabulary} to create a new
vocabulary. By default, a vocabulary called \emph{Topic} already exists.
When adding new categories, make sure you're adding them to the correct
vocabulary.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Clicking on a vocabulary on the left displays any categories that have
been created under that vocabulary. To create a new vocabulary, click on
the \emph{Add Vocabulary} button. Enter a name and, optionally, a
description. By default, the \emph{Allow Multiple Categories} box is
checked. This allows multiple categories from the vocabulary to be
applied to an asset. If the box is unchecked, only one category from the
vocabulary can be applied to add asset. The \emph{Associated Asset
Types} lets you choose which asset types the categories of the
vocabulary can be applied to and which asset types are \emph{required}
to have an associated asset from the vocabulary. Lastly, you can
configure the permissions of the vocabulary. Should the vocabulary be
viewable by guests? Only site members? Only owners? Which of these roles
should be able to delete the vocabulary, update it, or edit its
permissions? By default, guests can view the vocabulary but only the
owner can delete it, update it, or configure its permissions.

Creating new categories is similar to creating new tags except that
categories must be added to an existing vocabulary and they can only be
create by site administrators. However, once created, regular users can
apply categories to any assets they have permission to create or edit.
To create a new category, click the \emph{Add Category} button in the
categories administration portlet. Enter a name for the new category
and, optionally, a description. Use the \emph{To Vocabulary} dropdown
list to select a vocabulary to which to add the category. Just as with
tags, you can configure the permissions of the category, choosing which
roles (guest, site member, owner) can view the category, apply it to an
asset, delete it, update it, or configure its permissions. By default,
categories are viewable by guests and site members can apply categories
to assets. Also, you can add properties to categories, just as with
tags. Category properties are a way to add information to specific
categories. You can think of category properties as tags for your
categories. Structurally, category properties are just like tag
properties: they are key-value pairs associated with specific categories
that provide information about the categories.

Once you have created some vocabularies and categories, you can take
advantage of the full capabilities of categories by creating a nested
hierarchy of categories. To nest categories, select the category that
you'd like to be the parent category. Then drag any category that should
be a child category onto it. You will see a plus sign appear next to the
name of the category you are dragging if you can add it to the selected
parent category; if you see a red \emph{x} that means that you cannot
add that category as a subcategory of parent category that you have
selected.

After you have created a hierarchy of categories, your content creators
will have them available to apply to content that they create. Click on
\emph{Web Content} in the Content section of the Site Administration
area the Control Panel and click \emph{Add} \&rrar; \emph{Basic Web
Content}. Click on \emph{Categorization} from the right-side menu and
click \emph{Select} on the vocabulary you'd like to apply. A dialog box
appears with your categories. Select any relevant categories by checking
the box next to them, and they'll be applied to the content.

Liferay 6.1 added several new features to vocabularies and categories.
We mentioned a few of these already when we were discussing the
\emph{Allow Multiple Categories} and \emph{Required} checkboxes for
vocabularies and categories. The three new features are targeted
vocabularies, single/multi-valued vocabularies, and separated widgets
for every vocabulary.

\subsubsection{Targeted Vocabularies}\label{targeted-vocabularies}

Targeted Vocabularies allow you to decide which vocabularies can be
applied to an asset type and which vocabularies are required for an
asset type. To configure these settings, go to the categories
administration portlet in the Control Panel and mouse over the
vocabulary in the list until you see the edit icon to the right. Select
the icon to reveal a dialog box like the one below.

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/targeted-vocabularies.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.4: You can target vocabularies by checking the
\emph{Allow Multiple Categories} checkbox and then selecting the Asset
Types.}
\vspace{-14pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

The default value for \emph{Associated Asset Types} is \emph{All Asset
Types}. You can fine tune your choices by using the \emph{+} and
\emph{-} buttons, which narrows the scope of the vocabulary to specific
assets. In the screenshot above, notice that the vocabulary is
configured to be available for Web Content instances and Blog entries,
but it is not required. It is mandatory, however, for Documents and
Media files.

\subsubsection{Single and Multi-valued
Vocabularies}\label{single-and-multi-valued-vocabularies}

You can also decide if users can choose one or more categories from the
same vocabulary to apply to an asset. If a vocabulary is single-valued
you can only choose one. If it allows more, you can choose several
categories from the vocabulary to apply to an asset.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../../images/multi-valued-vocabularies.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.5: Multi-valued vocabularies allow multiple categories
from the vocabulary to be applied to an asset. Single-valued
vocabularies only allow one category from the vocabulary to be applied.
Here, the \emph{Cinema} and \emph{Music} categories are selected to be
applied but the \emph{Sports} category is not.}
\vspace{-14pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

You can configure the single-valued or multi-valued status of a
vocabulary through the categories administration portlet. Edit a
vocabulary and deselect the \emph{Allow Multiple Categories} checkbox to
create a single-valued vocabulary. Use the default option to create a
multi-valued vocabulary.

\subsubsection{Separated Widgets}\label{separated-widgets}

A third feature of vocabularies and categories is that every vocabulary
has its own separated widget. These widgets appear in the Categorization
section of the form for editing an asset and they allow users to easily
select appropriate categories for that asset.

It's important to use tags and categories with all your content, so that
content is easier for users to find. Let's look at one of the ways users
will make use of tags and categories: searching for content.

\section{Searching for Content in
Liferay}\label{searching-for-content-in-liferay}

To stay organized, I (RS) used to use a paper-based planner. It had
different sections for various areas of my life. Its initial incarnation
came from a commercial company, but over the years I tweaked it into
something that worked for me. This final version (before I went digital)
had different tabs for different areas of my life that I wanted to keep
track of: daily items like tasks, notes, a spiritual section, and agenda
pages that kept track of things I needed to go over with specific
people. A planning section had tabs for projects, family, future items,
and reference.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\vspace{-14pt}
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/separated-widgets.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.6: Vocabularies have their own widgets, making it easy
to select available categories.}
\vspace{-14pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

Of course, since this was paper-based, it had its limitations. It was
kind of hard to find stuff. Did I put the note I'd written about that
new toy my daughter wanted in the notes section or in the family
section? Or maybe it was on my \emph{While Out} list, so I would
remember to buy it before her birthday?

Liferay content can be like this. That important information you
remember seeing--was it in a wiki article, a message boards post, or web
content? Did you remember to tag it? If you don't have this kind of
information, browsing to the content you're looking for could be
difficult. Thankfully, Liferay includes a powerful, faceted search
function. You can access this function through the Search portlet, which
lets you drill down through the different types of content, tags, and
categories to refine your search. Let's look at the search features
Liferay provides for specific kinds of content and then examine how to
use Liferay's faceted search.

\subsection{Searching for Specific Types of
Content}\label{searching-for-specific-types-of-content}

Liferay provides several applications that allow users and
administrators to search for content. First, there's the Search portlet.
The Search portlet can be placed on a page to allow users to search for
assets of any type. We'll learn how to use the Search portlet when we
discuss Liferay's faceted search feature in the next section. There's
also a Web Content Search portlet. This portlet can be placed on a page
to allow users to search for web content instances. Users can't use the
Web Content Search portlet to search for other kinds of content.
However, the Blogs, Wiki, Message Boards, Documents and Media, and Web
Content portlets all provide search bars that allow users to search
among the specific types of assets with which these portlets allow users
to interact. Note that all of these portlets are accessible from the
Control Panel. They can also, except for the Web Content portlet, be
placed on portal pages for end-users to use. The Web Content portlet is
not designed for end users; it's intended for administrative use only.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} The Web Content Search portlet is deprecated in Liferay
6.2 and will be removed in Liferay 7.0. The Web Content Search portlet
will be migrated to the Search portlet, which will be configured to only
search for web content.
\vspace{10pt}

\end{roundedframe}
In order for content to be searchable, it must first be indexed. Liferay
uses Lucene for indexing and searching for content. Please refer to the
Lucene section of the portal properties file if you'd like to customize
Liferay's indexing and search behavior. By default, Liferay indexes blog
posts, wiki articles, and message board posts, Documents and Media
files' descriptions, and web content instances. If a Documents and Media
file is a text file, the file's content is indexed as well. Comments on
blog posts, wiki articles, and Documents and Media files and text file
attachments to wiki articles and message board posts are also indexed.
Liferay automatically indexes content as it's added to the portal.

If you'd like to search among assets of a specific type and you'd like
to include comments and attachments in your search, use the search bar
of the appropriate portlet. For example, if you'd like to search for the
term \emph{Liferay} among wiki articles, enter the term \emph{Liferay}
into the Wiki portlet's search bar.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/wiki-search.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.7: When using the Wiki portlet's search bar to search
for \emph{Liferay}, wiki articles, comments, and attachments containing
the word \emph{Liferay} are returned.}
\end{figure}

Wiki articles, comments, and text file attachments containing the word
\emph{Liferay} are returned as search results. The search results
clearly show whether an individual search result is a wiki article, a
comment, or an attachment. In the next section, we'll see how the Search
portlet can be used to search through multiple types of content on
Liferay. Its faceted search feature is a powerful tool that allows users
to include or not include specific types of assets in a search. However,
the Search portlet does not return comments or attachments as search
results.

\subsection{Searching for Portal Content Using
Facets}\label{searching-for-portal-content-using-facets}

To get started using faceted search, drop the Search portlet on a page
and search for something. You'll see a page with results on the right
and a collection of \emph{facets} on the left.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/faceted-search-1.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.8: The first set of facets is content types. You can
drill down to specific types of content that contain the search terms
you entered.}
\end{figure}

Facets allow users of the Search portlet to select criteria with which
to filter search results. A facet is a combination of the information
about a specific indexed field, its terms, and their frequency. Facets
are typically named by the field in question. From the Search portlet's
Configuration window, administrators can configure the facets available
to users for filtering search results. The default facets include the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Site
\item
  Asset type
\item
  Asset tag
\item
  Asset category
\item
  Folder
\item
  User
\item
  Modified time range
\end{itemize}

For example, after searching for a certain term in the Search portlet,
clicking on a specific site filters the search results to only display
assets within the specified site. Clicking on a specific user filters
the search results to only display assets added by the specified user.
The frequency with which the term was found for each facet is listed in
parentheses after the facet. It may jog your memory to see that the term
you searched for appears in a blog entry, and that may be all you need
to find what you were looking for. If, however, your memory is more
foggy than that, or you're searching for something you're not sure is
actually there, then the asset tags or asset categories facets may be
more helpful to you.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/faceted-search-2.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.9: Asset tag facets let you see how many assets
contain the terms for which you searched \emph{and} contain certain
tags. Click on a specific tag to narrow down the list of search results
to those to which the tag has been applied.}
\end{figure}

For example, if you searched for a wireless phone, you might be more
interested in content that has your search terms in it \emph{and} has
also been tagged by users. One or more tags might help you to find what
you're looking for. Note that the number of tags that appear is
configurable: by default it's 10, but there could be many more as a
result of a particular search. We'll look at the configuration options
later in the chapter. For now, let's learn how to drill down to narrow
search results.

To drill down into the search, click on a facet to add it to the filter
list. The results to the right are refined by the selected facets.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-faceted-search-drill-down-1.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.10: Drilling down creates a list of what you selected
at the top of the screen.}
\end{figure}

Here, we've refined the search to only show documents. We've also
selected one of the tags, \emph{cool}, to refine the search. The facets
we've selected, \emph{Document} and \emph{cool}, appear in a list at the
top, and there's a red ``X'' next to it that lets us remove it from our
filter as we work to refile our search. Suppose that the two facets we
selected weren't enough to filter our search into a small enough list to
sort through. In this case, we could further refine the search by
selecting another facet, as below.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-faceted-search-drill-down-2.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.11: Selecting another facet further refines the
search.}
\end{figure}

Now we've also selected the \emph{Music} category, which reduces the
list of search hits on the right. In this way, you can interactively
tweak the search results to narrow them down, making it easier to find
that proverbial needle within the haystack.

\subsubsection{Asset Types}\label{asset-types}

Searching can only be done on assets. As has already been described in
this chapter, just about any entity in the portal is an asset and can be
indexed and searched. Under the hood, this means that these entities use
Liferay's Asset API and have an Indexer class defined.

Developers can create custom searchable assets within the portal. This
is described in the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/learning-paths/mvc/-/knowledge_base/6-2/asset-enabling-custom-entities}{Asset
Framework}. section of the Liferay Developer Network. For this reason, you can
have additional asset types defined in your portal beyond the ones that
Liferay ships with by default. If this is the case, you might want to
tweak the \texttt{frequencyThreshold} and the \texttt{maxTerms} settings
to increase the number of asset types displayed past the default of 10.
This is covered in the section below on search options.

\subsubsection{Asset Tags}\label{asset-tags}

If tags have been applied to any asset that appears in the result set,
it may be displayed in the Asset Tag facet. Tags are handled in a
similar way to how asset types are handled: not all tags may appear.
There may be many more than the 10 tags listed, but the default
configuration for this facet is to show the top 10 most frequent terms.
As with asset types, this can be modified by setting the
\texttt{max terms} property.

\subsubsection{Asset Categories}\label{asset-categories}

If categories have been applied to any asset that appears in the result
set, they may be displayed in the Asset Categories facet. Asset
categories work just like asset tags. As with asset tags, you can modify
the number of categories listed in the search by setting the
\texttt{max terms} property.

Let's move on to advanced searching.

\subsection{Advanced Searching}\label{advanced-searching}

The Search portlet's search box is deceptively simple. Though you have
only a single field for search, there's a search syntax inherited from
\href{http://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_3/queryparsersyntax.html}{Lucene}
that lets you create very powerful search queries. Let's look at some
ways you can use search queries.

\textbf{Searching for specific fields:} By default, searches are
performed against a long list of fields. Sometimes you want results for
a term within a particular field. This can be achieved using the field
search syntax \texttt{{[}field{]}:{[}term{]}}. For example, to search in
the \emph{Title} field for \emph{Liferay}, use the following syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
title:liferay
\end{verbatim}

If you search for a phrase within a field, surround the term with double
quotation marks:

\begin{verbatim}
title:"Liferay Portal"
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Wildcards:} You can use wildcards in exactly the way you use
them with your operating system: for a single character wildcard, use
\texttt{?}; for the multiple character wildcard, use \texttt{*}.

\textbf{Boolean operators:} You can use logic operators, such as AND,
OR, NOT, \texttt{+}, and \texttt{-} in your searches. The \texttt{AND}
operator matches assets in which the terms between the \texttt{AND}
operator exist. For example, to search for both Liferay and Kaleo
Workflow, use this query:

\begin{verbatim}
"liferay" AND "kaleo workflow"
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{OR} operator is the default; if there's no operator between
two terms, the \texttt{OR} operator takes effect. \texttt{OR} finds
matches if any term exists in an asset.

The \texttt{+} operator requires that the term exists somewhere in some
field in the asset. If you wanted to search for something that
\emph{must} contain \emph{liferay} and \emph{may} contain \emph{portal},
use this query:

\begin{verbatim}
+liferay portal
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{NOT} operator excludes assets that contain the term after
the \texttt{NOT} operator. It requires that at least two terms be
present:

\begin{verbatim}
"Liferay Portal" NOT "Liferay Social Office" 
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{-} operator is similar: it excludes assets that contain the
term after the \texttt{-} symbol:

\begin{verbatim}
"Liferay Portal" - "Liferay Social Office" 
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Grouping:} You can use parentheses within your queries to form
sub-queries, in a similar fashion to an SQL statement. For example, to
search for \emph{liferay} or \emph{social office} and \emph{website},
use this query:

\begin{verbatim}
(liferay OR "social office") AND website
\end{verbatim}

As you can see, the search syntax is very powerful. There's more you can
do with it than what is listed here; to view the full syntax, visit the
Lucene URL above.

Next, we'll look at how the Search portlet can be configured.

\subsection{Setting Search Options}\label{setting-search-options}

As with Liferay's other portlets, you can configure the Search portlet
via the configuration screen, which looks like the below illustration.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-faceted-search-configuration.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.12: Basic search configuration is pretty
straightforward.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Display Asset Type Facet:} Toggles whether the Asset Type facet
appears.

\textbf{Display Asset Tags Facet:} Toggles whether the Asset Tags facet
appears.

\textbf{Display Asset Categories Facet:} Toggles whether the Asset
Categories facet appears.

\textbf{Display Modified Range Facet:} Toggles whether the date modified
range facet appears.

\textbf{Display Results in Document Form:} Never use this in production.
Developers use this feature to view search responses in their generic,
Document-based format. Part of a developer's job when writing search
indexers is to convert Documents (the objects that get indexed) to the
actual object and back again. This option allows developers to see how
their objects are being indexed.

\textbf{View in Context:} When an asset is clicked, show it in the
portlet to which it belongs.

\textbf{Display Main Query:} Show the exact search query that the
portlet generated to the search engine. Again, never use this in
production; this is for development purposes only.

\textbf{Display Open Search Results:} Shows results from third party
Open Search plugins, if they are installed. This is for backward
compatibility only: developers are encouraged to re-design their search
code as described in \emph{Liferay in Action}, and then custom assets
are aggregated with native portal assets seamlessly.

These are the basic options. But you didn't miss the fact that there are
also advanced options, did you?

Configuring advanced search requires a bit more technical acumen than
you might expect, because there are so many properties to tweak.
Thankfully, in most instances, you shouldn't need to change a thing. If
you do, however, the configuration is done through a JSON object.

If you don't know what a JSON object is, don't worry: it's not a
difficult concept. JSON stands for \textbf{J}ava\textbf{S}cript
\textbf{O}bject \textbf{N}otation. An Object is a software development
term for anything that can be represented in code. Objects have
\emph{attributes}, or sometimes these are called \emph{fields}, and they
are very similar to fields you'd find on a form that you're filling out.
Software developers use the word \emph{object} to refer generically to
anything like this that they can describe in the software; for all
intents and purposes, objects could just as easily have been called
Things. For example, one type of object used in Liferay is a User. A
User can be represented in code, and it has many \emph{fields}, such as
a name, an email address, and more. JSON is one way of describing
objects like this.

The object we're concerned with is called \texttt{facets}. Here's what
it looks like, in all its glory, in JSON. Explanation of the settings
follows the object below.

\begin{verbatim}
{"facets": [
    {
    "displayStyle": "asset_entries",
    "weight": 1.5,

        ],
        "frequencyThreshold": 1
    },
    "label": "asset-type",
    "className": "com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.AssetEntriesFacet",
    "fieldName": "entryClassName"
    },
    {

        "frequencyThreshold": 1,
        "showAssetCount": true
    },
    "label": "tag",
    "className": "com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.MultiValueFacet",
    "fieldName": "assetTagNames"
    },
    {
    "displayStyle": "asset_tags",
    "weight": 1.3,
    "static": false,
    "order": "OrderHitsDesc",
    "data": {
        "maxTerms": 10,
        "displayStyle": "list",
        "frequencyThreshold": 1,
        "showAssetCount": true
    },
    "label": "category",
    "className": "com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.MultiValueFacet",
    "fieldName": "assetCategoryTitles"
    },
    {
    "displayStyle": "modified",
    "weight": 1.1,
    "static": false,
    "order": "OrderHitsDesc",
    "data": {
        "ranges": [
        {
            "range": "[past-hour TO *]",
            "label": "past-hour"
        },
        {
            "range": "[past-24-hours TO *]",
            "label": "past-24-hours"
        },
        {
            "range": "[past-week TO *]",
            "label": "past-week"
        },
        {
            "range": "[past-month TO *]",
            "label": "past-month"
        },
        {
            "range": "[past-year TO *]",
            "label": "past-year"
        }
        ],
        "frequencyThreshold": 0
    },
    "label": "modified",
    "className": "com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.ModifiedFacet",
    "fieldName": "modified"
    }
]}
\end{verbatim}

Now that you've seen the object, don't be daunted by it. Here are all
the settings within the object that you can tweak.

\textbf{``className'':} This field must contain a string value which is
the FQCN (fully qualified class name) of a java implementation class
implementing the Facet interface. Liferay provides the following
implementations by default:

\begin{verbatim}
com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.AssetEntriesFacet
com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.ModifiedFacet
com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.MultiValueFacet
com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.RangeFacet
com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.ScopeFacet
com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.SimpleFacet
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{``data'':} This field takes an arbitrary JSON object (a.k.a.
\{\}) for use by a specific facet implementation. As such, there is no
fixed definition of the data field. Each implementation is free to
structure it as needed. The value defined here matches the
implementation that's selected in the \texttt{className} attribute
above.

\textbf{``displayStyle'':} This field takes a string value and
represents a particular template implementation which is used to render
the facet. These templates are normally JSP pages (but can also be
implemented as Velocity or Freemarker templates provided by a theme if
the portal property \texttt{theme.jsp.override.enabled} is set to
\texttt{true}). The method of matching the string to a JSP is simply
done by prefixing the string with \texttt{/html/port\-let/search/fa\-cets/} and
appending the .jsp extension.

For example, \texttt{"displayStyle": "asset\_tags"} maps to the JSP

\begin{verbatim}
/html/portlet/search/facets/asset_tags.jsp
\end{verbatim}

Armed with this knowledge a crafty developer could create custom display
styles by deploying custom (new or overriding) JSPs using a JSP hook.
See the \emph{Liferay Developer Network} or \emph{Liferay in Action} for more
information on hook plugins.

\textbf{``fieldName'':} This field takes a string value and defines the
indexed field on which the facet operates.

For example, \texttt{"fieldName": "entryClassName"} indicates that the
specified facet implementation operates on the \texttt{entryClassName}
indexed field.

\textbf{Note:} You can identify available indexed fields by enabling the
Search portlet's \emph{Display Results in Document Form} configuration
setting and then expanding individual results by clicking the \emph{+}
symbol to the left of their titles.

\textbf{``label'':} This field takes a string value and represents the
language key that is used for localizing the title of the facet when
it's rendered.

\textbf{``order'':} This field takes a string value. There are two
possible values:

\texttt{OrderValueAsc}: This tells the facet to sort it's results by the
term values, in ascending order.

\texttt{OrderHitsDesc}: This tells the facet to sort it's results by the
term frequency, in descending order.

\textbf{``static'':} This field takes a boolean value (\texttt{true} or
\texttt{false}). The default value is false. A value of \texttt{true}
means that the facet should not actually be rendered in the UI. It also
means that it should use pre-set values (stored in its \texttt{data}
field) rather than inputs dynamically applied by the end user. This
allows for the creation of pre-configured search results.

Imagine you would like to create a pre-configured search that returns
only images (i.e.~the asset type is
\texttt{com.life\-ray.port\-let.doc\-u\-ment\-li\-bra\-ry.mo\-del.DL\-File\-En\-try} and the
indexed field extension should contain the values bmp, gif, jpeg, jpg,
odg, png, or svg). We would need two static facets, one with
``fieldName'': ``entryClassName'' and another with ``fieldName'':
``extension''. This could be represented using the following facet
configuration:

\begin{verbatim}
{
    "displayStyle": "asset_entries",
    "static": true,
    "weight": 1.5,
    "order": "OrderHitsDesc",
    "data": {
    "values": [
        "com.liferay.portlet.documentlibrary.model.DLFileEntry"
    ],
    "frequencyThreshold": 0
    },
    "className": "com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.AssetEntriesFacet",
    "label": "asset-type",
    "fieldName": "entryClassName"
},
{
    "displayStyle": "asset_entries",
    "static": true,
    "weight": 1.5,
    "order": "OrderHitsDesc",
    "data": {
    "values": ["bmp", "gif", "jpeg", "jpg", "odg", "png", "svg"],
    "frequencyThreshold": 0
    },
    "className": "com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.MultiValueFacet",
    "label": "images",
    "fieldName": "extension"
}
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{``weight'':} This field takes a floating point (or double) value
and is used to determine the ordering of the facets in the facet column
of the search portlet. Facets are positioned with the largest values at
the top. (yes, the current implementation is counter-intuitive and
perhaps could be reversed in future versions).

Configuring search using a JSON object is a bit unusual, but as you can
see, it's not as hard as it looks initially.

\subsection{Summary}\label{summary-5}

Search is a powerful component of Liferay Portal's asset framework. The
proclivity of assets means that there is an extensible, robust, and
configurable search mechanism throughout the portal that allows
administrators to optimize the search experience of their users. Users
also get an easy to use search interface that makes use of the tags and
categories that they themselves apply to various pieces of content,
regardless of the type of content. This makes Liferay's search truly
``for the people.''

There is an extended search syntax that lets you craft
very specific searches. These searches can be used on large
installations with lots of data to find the proverbial needle in the
proverbial haystack. Administrators can tune the configuration of search
portlets so that they are optimized for the contents of their
communities.

Next, we'll look at how the Asset Publisher portlet makes even more
extensive use of Liferay's asset framework to bring relevant content to
users.

\section{Using the Asset Publisher}\label{using-the-asset-publisher}

As we create web content, it's important to keep in mind that to
Liferay, the pieces of content are assets, just like message board
entries and blog posts. This allows you to publish different kinds of
content using Liferay's Asset Publisher. You can use the Asset Publisher
to publish a mixed group of various kinds of assets such as images,
documents, blogs, and of course, web content. This helps in creating a
more dynamic web site: you can place user-created wiki entries, blog
posts, or message board messages in context with your content. Let's
examine some of its features.

\subsection{Querying for Content}\label{querying-for-content}

The Asset Publisher portlet is a highly configurable application that
lets you query for mixed types of content on the fly. By giving you the
ability to control what and how content is displayed from one location,
the Asset Publisher helps you to ``bubble up'' the most relevant content
to your users.

To get to all the portlet's options, click the \emph{Options} button in
the portlet's menu (the gear icon). On the Setup tab, you can configure
the Asset Publisher's settings from the following three areas:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Asset Selection
\item
  Display Settings
\item
  Subscriptions
\end{itemize}

Asset Selection allows you to configure which assets are displayed. You
can set asset selection to either \emph{dynamic} or \emph{manual}. With
dynamic asset selection, assets are automatically displayed based on
certain rules or filters. For example, you can set the Asset Publisher
to display only assets of a certain type or assets to which certain tags
or categories have been applied. With manual asset selection, the Asset
Publisher only displays assets that have been explicitly selected by an
administrator.

The Asset Publisher supports a scope that restricts both manual and
dynamic asset selection. The Asset Publisher can only display assets
from its configured scope. By default, the Asset Publisher portlet is
scoped to the site of the page to which it was added. However, you can
customize the scope from the Asset Selection section of the Asset
Publisher configuration window. To extend your Asset Publisher's scope,
click \emph{Select} under Scope and choose either \emph{Global} to add
the global scope or \emph{Other Site\ldots{}} to add the scope of anther
site.

The Display Settings section of the Asset Publisher configuration window
lets administrators customize many details that determine how content is
displayed. The Subscription section allows administrators to enable,
disable, or configure email subscriptions and RSS subscriptions. In the
following sections, we'll explore the available configurations for the
Asset Selection, Display Settings, and Subscriptions sections of the
Asset Publisher's configuration window. Let's start by learning how
select content manually. You'll see that it's very similar to using the
Web Content Display portlet except that you can select assets of any
type, not just web content instances.

\subsubsection{Selecting Assets
Manually}\label{selecting-assets-manually}

By selecting \emph{Manual} from the select box beneath \emph{Asset
Selection}, you tell the Asset Publisher that you want to select content
manually. You can configure multiple scopes, including the global scope,
from which to select assets.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-asset-publisher-manual.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.13: Selecting assets in the Asset Publisher manually
is similar to selecting assets in the Web Content Display portlet except
that you can select assets of any type, not just web content. You can
also add scopes to expand the list of assets that available to be
displayed in the Asset Publisher.}
\end{figure}

When selecting assets manually, you'll see a list of configured scopes
under the Scope heading. Click the red ``X'' button at the right to
remove a scope from the list. Click the \emph{Select} button to add
additional scopes to the Asset Publisher's configuration. After you've
added a scope, a new Select button appears under the Asset Entries
heading. A list of assets selected for display appears in the Asset
Entries section. You can select assets to be displayed by clicking on
the appropriate \emph{Select} button. One button appears for each
configured scope. By default, the available asset types include the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Documents Folder
\item
  Bookmarks Folder
\item
  Blogs Entry
\item
  Message Boards Message
\item
  Web Content Instance
\item
  Bookmarks Entry
\item
  Wiki Page
\item
  Document
\item
  Web Content Folder
\end{itemize}

You can select any number of assets to be displayed. Note, however, that
there's a display setting called \emph{Number of Items to Display} that
determines the maximum number of items to display (or, if pagination is
enabled, the maximum number of items to display per page). The Asset
Publisher enables you to mix and match different asset types in the same
interface. When you're done selecting items to display, click
\emph{Save}. Any selected assets are added to the list of assets that
are displayed by the portlet. Once you have your content selected, you
can configure the display types to configure how the content appears.
We'll discuss the display settings in more detail after we finish
discussing how to select assets for display.

While manual Asset selection allows you to select assets of various
types from different scopes, it can be time-consuming to periodically
update the assets that should be displayed. It's often more convenient
to use the Asset Publisher to select content dynamically.

\subsubsection{Selecting Assets
Dynamically}\label{selecting-assets-dynamically}

The Asset Publisher's default behavior is to select assets dynamically
according a set of customizable rules. These rules can be stacked on top
of each other so that they compliment each other to create a nice,
refined query for your content. You can define complicated rules for
selecting assets for display and Liferay automatically takes permissions
into account. Liferay's Asset Publisher performs well in these
situations since it queries by search index instead of querying the
database directly. You have the following options for creating rules for
selecting content:

\textbf{Scope:} Choose the sites from which the content should be
selected. This works the same way as with manual asset selection: assets
can only be displayed if they belong to a configured scope.

\textbf{Asset Type:} Choose whether you'll display any assets or only
assets of a specific type, such as only web content, only wiki entries,
or any combination of multiple types.

\textbf{Filter Rules:} Add as many filters on tags or categories as you
like. You can choose whether the content must contain or must not
contain any or all of the tags or categories that you enter.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-asset-publisher-filter.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.14: You can filter by tags and categories, and you can
set up as many filter rules as you need.}
\end{figure}

Once you've set up your filter rules for dynamically selecting content,
you can decide how the content will be displayed.

You can order the content returned by the filters by title, create date,
modified date, publication date, etc. in ascending or descending order.
For instance, suppose you have a series of ``How To'' articles that you
want displayed in descending order based on whether the article was
tagged with the \emph{hammer} tag. Or, suppose you want a series of
video captures to display in ascending order based on a category called
\emph{birds}. For these use cases, you can configure the ordering and
grouping settings. You can also group by \emph{Asset}, \emph{Type} or
\emph{Vocabularies}. Vocabularies are groups of categories defined by
administrators in the \emph{Categories} section of the Control Panel.

The \emph{Ordering and Grouping} section of the Asset Publisher allows
you to precisely control how content is ordered and grouped when
displayed. You can order the assets displayed by Asset Publisher in
ascending or descending order by the following attributes:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Title
\item
  Create Date
\item
  Modified Date
\item
  Publish Date
\item
  Expiration Date
\item
  Priority
\end{itemize}

You can also configure a second ordering. The second ordering would be
applied to any assets for which the first ordering wasn't sufficient.
For example, suppose you chose to order assets by title and there are
multiple assets with the same title. Then the second ordering would take
effect. For example, you could order all the assets that had the same
title by their publication dates.

You can establish grouping rules as well as ordering rules. You can
group assets by type or by vocabulary. For example, suppose there's a
vocabulary called \emph{Membership Type} that belongs to your site.
Suppose this vocabulary has two categories: \emph{Premium} and
\emph{Regular}. If you group assets by Membership Type, all assets with
the Premium category will be displayed in one group and all assets with
the Regular category will be displayed in another group. Grouping rules
are applied before any ordering rules: they're a way to divide up the
displayed assets into separate lists. The ordering rules are applied
separately to each group of assets.

Note that grouping and ordering rules are only one mechanism to control
how your content will be displayed. You can refine the display through
many other display settings which we'll examine next.

\subsection{Configuring Display
Settings}\label{configuring-display-settings}

Open the \emph{Display Settings} subtab of the Setup tab of the Asset
Publisher's Configuration window. Here, you can configure many more
settings that control the Asset Publisher's behavior and that determine
how the Asset Publisher displays content. The Display Settings section
gives you precise control over the display of your assets. There are
many options available to configure how you want your content to appear.
Many of these, such as printing, flags, ratings, comments, comment
ratings, and social bookmarks work the same way they do in the Web
Content Display portlet.

\textbf{Show Add Content Button}: When checked, this checkbox adds an
\emph{Add New} button that allows users to add new assets directly from
the Asset Publisher portlet. This is checked by default.

\textbf{Display Template}: This selector lets you choose an application
display template to customize how the Asset Publisher displays assets.
Liferay creates the following display templates for each newly created
site, including the default site:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Abstracts: This display template shows the first 200-500 characters of
  the content, defined by the \textbf{Abstract Length} field. This is
  the default display template of the Asset Publisher.
\item
  Table: This display template displays the content in an HTML table
  which can be styled by a theme developer.
\item
  Title List: This display template displays the content's title as
  defined by the user who entered it.
\item
  Full Content: This display template displays the entire content of the
  entry.

  There's also a Rich Summary display template that belongs to the
  global scope. This template provides a summary view of each asset
  along with a \emph{Read More} link to the article's full content.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Abstract Length}: Here, you can select the number of characters
to display for abstracts. The default is \texttt{200}.

\textbf{Asset Link Behavior:} The default value is \emph{Show Full
Content}. With this value selected, when the link to an asset is
clicked, the full asset is displayed in the current Asset Publisher.
(There's also a \emph{View in Context} link that shows the article in
the Wiki page's Wiki portlet.) If the value \emph{View in a Context} is
selected, clicking on an asset causes that asset to be displayed in the
portlet to which the asset belongs. For example, a blog entry would be
displayed in the Blogs portlet where it was created. Likewise, a forum
post would be displayed in the Message Boards portlet where it was
created. Similarly, a generic web content instance would be displayed in
the Asset Publisher of its configured display page. See the section
below on display pages for more information.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} When the Asset Publisher displays web content instances
that have an associated small image, the small image becomes a link to
the full instance. To use this feature, add or edit a web content
instance that the Asset Publisher should display. Before clicking
\emph{Publish}, click on \emph{Abstracts}, flag \emph{Small Image}, and
upload an image. Then click \emph{Publish}. Once your web content
instance appears in the Asset Publisher's list, clicking the small image
takes you to the full instance.

\end{roundedframe}
\textbf{Number of Items to Display}: Here, you can select the maximum
number of assets that can be displayed by the Asset Publisher. However,
if pagination is enabled, there's no limit to the number of of assets
that the Asset Publisher can display. So with pagination enabled, this
number represents the maximum number of assets that can be displayed per
page.

\textbf{Pagination Type}: This can be set to \emph{None}, \emph{Simple},
or \emph{Regular}. With pagination set to \emph{None}, the Asset
Publisher displays at most the number of assets specified in the
\textbf{Number of Items to Display} property. Setting the pagination
type to \emph{Simple} adds \emph{Previous} and \emph{Next} buttons that
enable the user to browse through ``pages'' of assets in the Asset
Publisher. Setting the pagination type to \emph{Regular} adds more
options and information including \emph{First} and \emph{Last} buttons,
a dropdown selector for pages, the number of items per page, and the
total number of results (assets being displayed).

\textbf{Show Available Locales:} Since content can be localized, you can
have different versions of it based on locale. Enabling this option
shows the locales available, enabling users to view the content in their
language of choice.

\textbf{Set as the Default Asset Publisher for This Page}: The Asset
Publisher portlet is an instanceable portlet; multiple Asset Publishers
can be added to a page and each has an independent configuration. The
default Asset Publisher for a page is the one used to display any web
content associated with the page.

\textbf{Enable Conversion To:} If you have enabled Liferay Portal's
OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration, you can allow your users to convert
the content to one of several formats:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  DOC
\item
  ODT
\item
  PDF
\item
  RTF
\item
  SXW
\item
  TXT

  Please refer to the User Guide's section on
  \href{https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/server-administration-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-17-en}{Liferay
  Server Administration} for information on setting up Liferay's
  OpenOffice/LibreOffice document conversion functionality.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Enable \ldots{}}: The Asset Publisher's Display Settings allow
you to enable/disable the following options for displayed assets:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Print
\item
  Flags
\item
  Related assets
\item
  Ratings
\item
  Comments
\item
  Comment ratings
\item
  Social bookmarks

  Enabling the Print option adds a \emph{Print} link to the full view of
  an asset displayed in the Asset Publisher. Clicking \emph{Print} opens
  a new browser window with a print view of the asset. Enabling flags,
  related assets, ratings, comments, comment ratings, or social
  bookmarks add links to the corresponding social features to the view
  full of the asset in the Asset Publisher.
\end{itemize}

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} An alternate way to add comments and ratings to a page is
through the \emph{Page Comments} and \emph{Page Ratings} portlets. Just
add the portlets in the appropriate location near the asset you'd like
to have feedback for. Note that starting in Liferay 6.2, these portlets
can no longer be exported.

\end{roundedframe}
\textbf{Show Metadata:} Allows you to select various metadata types to
be displayed (see below). For example, you can select tags and
categories for display. Upon saving your configuration, the Asset
Publisher displays tags and categories for each displayed asset. Then
users can click on the tags and categories to manually filter the
displayed assets.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/available-metadata-fields.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.15: You can configure the Asset Publisher to display
various kinds of metadata about the displayed assets.}
\end{figure}

The Display Settings section of the Asset Publisher has numerous options
to help you configure how your content selections are displayed to your
users. Even though there are many choices, it's easy to go through the
options and quickly adjust the ones that apply to your situation. You'll
want to use the Asset Publisher to query for different kinds of assets
in the portal that contain relevant information for your users.

\subsection{Configuring Asset Publisher
Subscriptions}\label{configuring-asset-publisher-subscriptions}

The Asset Publisher portlet supports two kinds of subscriptions: RSS
subscriptions and email subscriptions. To enable subscriptions, open the
Asset Publisher's configuration window (click on the gear icon and
select \emph{Configuration}). In the configuration window, open the
Subscriptions tab of the Setup tab. There are two options:

\textbf{Enable RSS Subscription}

\textbf{Enable Email Subscription}

Enabling RSS subscription creates an RSS feed containing links to all of
the assets that the Asset Publisher is configured to display. A link to
this RSS feed appears in at the bottom of the Asset Publisher portlet.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/asset-publisher-rss.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.16: When RSS subscriptions have been enabled for an
Asset Publisher portlet, a link to the Asset Publisher's RSS feed
appears. Users can subscribe to the Asset Publisher's RSS feed using
their preferred RSS reader.}
\end{figure}

Enabling email subscription adds a \emph{Subscribe} link to the Asset
Publisher. Users wishing to be notified of newly published assets can
click on this link to be added to the subscription list. Liferay
periodically checks for new assets and sends emails to subscribed users
informing them about the new assets. By default, Liferay performs this
check every twenty-four hours but this can be customized by adding the
following property to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file and
changing the number:

\begin{verbatim}
asset.publisher.check.interval=24
\end{verbatim}

Also by default, Liferay limits the number of assets that are retrieved
from the database during this check to twenty. If you're interested in
optimizing Liferay's performance, you can lower this limit. If you're
not concerned about performance, you can remove this limit entirely. To
customize the number of assets about which Liferay notifies subscribed
users, add the following property to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties}
file and change the number:

\begin{verbatim}
asset.publisher.dynamic.subscription.limit=20
\end{verbatim}

Next, we'll look at Display Pages, an addition to the asset framework
introduced by Liferay 6.1.

\subsection{Content Display Pages}\label{content-display-pages}

If you've been using Liferay for a while, you might have noticed
something about how Liferay handles web content--content is never tied
directly to a page. While this can be useful (because it means that you
don't have to recreate content if you want to display the same thing on
multiple pages), it also means that you don't have a static URL for any
web content, which is bad for search engine optimization.

As an improvement, Liferay introduced the concept of \emph{display
pages} and \emph{canonical URLs}. Each web content entry on the portal
has a canonical URL, which is the official location of the content that
is referenced any time the content is displayed. A display page can be
any page with an asset publisher configured to display any content
associated with the page. When adding or editing web content, you can
select a display page, but only pages with a configured asset publisher
are available for selection.

To create a display page, you can create a page yourself, add an Asset
Publisher portlet and configure it yourself. Alternatively, you can use
the \emph{Content Display Page} page template included with Liferay. If
you're creating a Display Page manually, once you've added an Asset
Publisher portlet to the page, open its configuration window. Then check
the \emph{Set as the Default Asset Publisher for This Page} box. Also,
for its display settings, set the Display Style to \emph{Abstracts} and
the Asset Link Behavior to \emph{View in Context}.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} Web content linked in the Asset Publisher can be viewed
by clicking their asset links. With the \emph{View in Context} behavior
checked, the link displays the Web Content in its configured display
page. If the web content does not have a configured display page, it is
displayed in the web content display portlet to which the asset belongs.

\end{roundedframe}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-display-page.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.17: You can select a display page for a web content
instance when creating or editing one.}
\end{figure}

You may now be thinking, ``Wait, you just told me that each Web Content
item has its own URL, and that this is somehow related to pages where we
display a whole bunch of content on the same page?'' That's right. Just
watch--create a display page called \emph{My Web Content Display Page}
somewhere on your portal, using the \emph{Content Display Page}
template. Now, on a different page, add a Web Content Display portlet.
Click the \emph{Add Web Content} button, enter a title and some content,
click on \emph{Display Page} at the right, and select the Display Page
you just created. Then click \emph{Publish}.

In the Asset Publisher of the \emph{My Web Content Display Page}, click
the \emph{Read More} link to display the full content. Notice that the
canonical URL for content appears in your browser's address bar. If you
create your own custom display page, any additional portlets that you
place on the page are displayed along with the content when you access
it via the canonical URL. If you used the \emph{Content Display Page}
page template for your display page, it not only features a configured
Asset Publisher portlet but also a Tags Navigation, a Categories
Navigation, and a Search portlet. These tools help users to quickly
identify relevant content.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-web-content-canonical-url.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.18: The Canonical URL}
\end{figure}

Next, let's learn about another new feature introduced by Liferay 6.1.

\section{Defining Content
Relationships}\label{defining-content-relationships}

Related Assets was a feature introduced in Liferay 6.1 that enables you
to connect an asset to other assets within the same site or to global
assets, even if they don't share any tags and aren't in the same
category. We've already seen that you can show related assets within the
display for a specific asset, and with the Related Assets portlet you
can show links to any assets which are related to content displayed on
that page.

The Related Assets portlet is based on the Asset Publisher and possesses
essentially the same interface with one key difference. The Asset
publisher displays any content that meets the criteria selected in the
portlet configuration. The Related Assets portlet only displays content
that meets the criteria, and also is listed as a related asset for a
piece of content that is currently published on the page where it is
placed. Let's take a look at the Related Assets portlet.

As a prerequisite for the Related Assets portlet to display related
assets, you have to configure it to show the content you want displayed.
To do this, go to the Asset Publisher portlet and select the \emph{gear}
icon in the upper right corner of the portlet. Under the \emph{Setup}
tab, set type of asset(s) to display using the \emph{Asset Type} menu.
The default value is set to \emph{Any}. You can narrow the scope of the
portlet to display any single category of asset type or select multiple
assets from the menu.

Filter options let you set minimum requirements for displaying assets by
their categories, tags, and custom fields. Ordering and Grouping allows
you to organize assets using the same criteria. Display settings allow
you to customize how assets are shown in the portlet. They can be listed
by title, in a table, by abstract or full content. You can convert
assets to different document types like ODT, PDF, and RTF. You can
choose to show various metadata fields such as author, modification
date, tags, and view count. You can even enable RSS subscriptions and
customize their display settings.

When you are finished setting the Source and Filter options, click
\emph{Save}. But hold on a minute. You saw the message that says,
\texttt{You have successfully updated the setup}, but there still aren't
any assets displayed in the related assets portlet. Why? You cannot see
any related assets until you select an asset in the Asset Publisher.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/related-assets-portlet-after.png}
\caption{\\Figure 6.19: Select an asset in the Asset Publisher to see its
related assets displayed in the Related Assets portlet. In the
screenshot, we renamed the three Related Assets portlets on the left and
updated their configurations.}
\end{figure}

Once you select an asset, its related assets are displayed in the
Related Assets portlet, as in the image above.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-6}

In this chapter, we explored Liferay's asset framework. Any type of
content in Liferay is considered an asset and can utilize the features
provided by the asset framework: tags, categories, comments, ratings,
and relationships. We examined the Asset Publisher portlet and looked at
the many configuration options for choosing what kinds of assets to
display and how to display them. We saw that the Asset Publisher portlet
is designed to integrate with the Tags Navigation and Categories
navigation portlets to allow users to browse content more easily. We
also learned about the Display Page attribute of web content, the
Content Display Page page template, and canonical URLs for assets.
Assets can have display page associated with them so that the full view
of the asset is displayed on the display page. The display page of an
asset is used in the asset's canonical URL.

\chapter{Targeting Content To Your
Audience}\label{targeting-content-to-your-audience}

Liferay's Audience Targeting app allows you to divide your audience into
user segments, target specific content to different user segments, and
create campaigns for different user segments. It also allows you to
quickly measure the effectiveness of your campaigns. User segments allow
you to configure your website to display different assets to different
users. Campaigns allow you to display specific content to different user
segments for fixed periods of time. They also allow you to measure the
interaction of the targeted user segments with the chosen content.

Suppose you'd like to display advertisements to users of your website.
You'd like to display one set of advertisements to one user segment and
another set of advertisements to another user segment. Maybe this should
dynamically change every week based on your marketing goals. Or maybe
you have created several sets of news articles for your website that
would be interesting to different user segments. You'd like to display
news articles to users based on all the user segments to which they
belong.

Liferay's Audience Targeting app, available from
\href{http://www.liferay.com/marketplace}{Liferay Marketplace}, allows
you to create multiple user segments which are defined by multiple rules
based on session attributes, profile attributes, behavior, and
information from social networks. Developers can easily create
additional rules and rule types with minimal coding efforts. The
Audience Targeting App also allows you to create campaigns that target a
specific user segment. Campaigns last for fixed periods of time and each
campaign has a priority. If you are running several campaigns on your
website at the same time, the priority field determines which campaign
takes precedence. Campaigns allow you to configure different assets to
be displayed at different periods of time to the targeted user segment.

The Audience Targeting App adds an \emph{Audience Targeting} section to
the Configuration section of the Site Administration area of the Control
Panel and an Audience Targeting Simulator to the Dockbar. The following
three applications are also included with the Audience Targeting app:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  User Segment Content Display
\item
  User Segment Content List
\item
  Campaign Content Display
\end{itemize}

You can add these applications to any portal page. In the next sections,
we'll explain how to use the \emph{Audience Targeting} section of the
Configuration section of the Site Administration area of the Control
Panel to manage user segments and campaigns. Then we'll explain how to
use each of Audience Targeting applications and the Audience Targeting
Simulator.

\section{Installation and
Uninstallation}\label{installation-and-uninstallation}

The easiest way to install the Audience Targeting app is via
\href{http://www.liferay.com/marketplace}{Liferay Marketplace}. Make
sure to install the correct version of the app. Choose
\href{https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/43707761}{CE}
if you're running Liferay CE and
\href{https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/43707691}{EE}
if you're running Liferay EE.

If you're running Liferay on JBoss, make sure to have your
\texttt{jboss-dep\-loy\-ment-struc\-ture.xml} file configured correctly. See
the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/6-2/installing-liferay-on-jboss-7-1}{Installing
Liferay on JBoss} instructions for details.

If you're running Liferay on Weblogic, note that the Audience Targeting
app is only supported on Liferay 6.2 EE SP10 and above.

If you can't uninstall the Audience Targeting app via Marketplace or you
want to manually uninstall it, follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Delete your \texttt{{[}Liferay Home{]}/data/osgi} folder.
\item
  Delete your app server's \texttt{work} and \texttt{temp} directories.
  E.g.., if you're running Liferay on Tomcat, delete your
  \texttt{{[}Liferay Home{]}/tomcat-{[}version{]}/work} and
  \texttt{{[}Liferay Home{]}/tomcat-{[}version{]}/temp} folders.
\item
  Restart your app server.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Managing User Segments}\label{managing-user-segments}

The \emph{Audience Targeting} section of the Configuration section of
the Site Administration area of the Control Panel allows you to manage
user segments and campaigns.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/07-audience-targeting-admin.png}
\caption{\\Figure 7.1: Click on \emph{Site Administration} →
\emph{Configuration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Audience Targeting} to manage user segments
and campaigns for a site.}
\end{figure}

A user segment represents a subset of the total group of portal users
(logged in or not). A user segment is defined by one or more rules that
users have to match in order to belong to that user segment. Click on
\emph{Site Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Configuration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Audience
Targeting} $\rightarrow$\emph{New User Segment} to add a new user segment. All the
rules that have been deployed appear under the Rules heading. Drag a
rule to the right to apply the rule to the user segment. Once a rule has
been applied, you can adjust the rule's parameters. E.g., once the
Gender rule has been applied, you can select \emph{Male} or
\emph{Female}. Once the Age rule has been applied, you can select an
\emph{Older than} value and a \emph{Younger than} value. For example,
you could define a \emph{Women over 30} user segment by applying the
Gender rule and selecting \emph{Female} and applying the Age rule and
setting the \emph{Older than} attribute to \emph{30}. Once you've
customized the rules for the new user segment, entered a name and,
optionally, a description, click \emph{Save} to actually create the user
segment.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/07-audience-targeting-rules.png}
\caption{\\Figure 7.2: Drag a rule to the right to create a user segment.}
\end{figure}

To configure permissions for creating, editing, and deleting user
segments, visit the Roles section of the Control Panel and search for
\emph{Audience Targeting Resources}.

Both user segments and campaigns are inherited in your site hierarchy.
Therefore, user segments and campaigns defined in the Global scope will
be available to any site. User segments and campaigns created in a site
will be available to all of its child sites.

\subsection{User Segment Rules}\label{user-segment-rules}

Custom rules can be created by developers and deployed as OSGi plugins.
See the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/extending-the-audience-targeting-application}{Extending
the Audience Targeting Application} tutorial for details.

These are some of the rules that are included with the app by default:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  User Attributes

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Age (from the user profile)
  \item
    Gender (from the user profile)
  \item
    Role (regular role, organization role or site role)
  \item
    Membership (site member, organization member, user group member)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Social

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Like of a specific Facebook page
  \item
    Number of Facebook friends
  \item
    City, Age, Gender, Education, etc. from your Facebook profile
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Session Attributes

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Location (obtained from the IP address)
  \item
    Browser, Device, Operating system
  \item
    Time
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Behavior

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Viewed page or content
  \item
    Score Points rule.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The Score Points rule assigns 1 point to a user each time the user views
a page or content that's been categorized under the user segment to
which the rule has been applied. Once a user exceeds the configured
threshold, the user matches this rule. For example, suppose that your
website is about sports and you have pages and content about basketball,
tennis, and soccer. You would like to divide your audience into three
user segments (Basketball fans, Tennis fans, and Soccer fans) in order
to display the most relevant content to them on your site's front page.
After creating these three user segments using the Score Points rule
with a threshold of, say, 20, you should appropriately categorize the
content which would be most relevant to each user segment. E.g., apply
the \emph{Basketball fans} user segment to content about basketball,
apply the \emph{Tennis fans} user segment to content about tennis, etc.
Now, every time a user (even a guest user) visits a page or views a
piece of content categorized for a user segment to which the Score
Points rule has been applied, the user will start accumulating points.
Once the user has accumulated enough points, the user will belong to the
user segment. After a user has visited more than 20 pages or pieces of
content related to basketball, the user will belong to the Basketball
fans user segment. Once the user belongs to a user segment, you can use
that information to direct more relevant information to the user in your
website using the User Segment Content Display application.

\subsection{Categorizing Pages and Content for User
Segments}\label{categorizing-pages-and-content-for-user-segments}

Each new user segment that's created can be used to categorize pages or
content.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} Page categorization is a feature added by the Audience
Targeting app. In a regular Liferay Portal 6.2 instance without the
Audience Targeting app installed, pages cannot be categorized.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}
The Audience Targeting app adds two select buttons to the Categorization
section of pages and assets: \emph{User Segment} and \emph{User Segment
(Global)}. These buttons allow you to assign one or more site-scoped or
global user segments to the content. This categorization has mainly two
purposes:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Assigning points to users using the Score Points rule
\item
  Showing dynamic lists of content in the User Segment Content List
  application
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/07-audience-targeting-categorization.png}
\caption{\\Figure 7.3: Pages and content can be categorized for user
segments.}
\end{figure}

You don't have to create categories for each of your user segments. User
segments are distinct from regular vocabularies. The Categorization
section of pages and assets contains distinct select buttons for user
segments and regular vocabularies.

\subsection{Managing User Segment
Reports}\label{managing-user-segment-reports}

When managing user segments, you can click \emph{Actions} →
\emph{Reports} next to a user segment to see the list of reports
available for each user segment. Click \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{View
Report} to view the report or \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Update Report} to
generate a new report. Reports display a summary of interesting
information related to each user segment. For example, the Content Views
report shows the asset that's been most viewed by users that belong to
the user segment.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/07-audience-targeting-user-segment-report.png}
\caption{\\Figure 7.4: the Content Views report shows the asset that's
been most viewed by users that belong to a user segment.}
\end{figure}

Additional reports can be created by developers and deployed as OSGI
plugins. See the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/extending-the-audience-targeting-application}{Extending
the Audience Targeting Application} tutorial for details. Reports are
generated daily by default. However, you can generate a report at any
time. To generate a new report when currently viewing a report, click on
the \emph{Update Report} button in the top right corner.

\section{Managing Campaigns}\label{managing-campaigns}

A campaign represents an effort to expose a certain user segment to a
certain set of assets within a specific period of time. To manage
campaigns for a site, navigate to \emph{Site Administration} →
\emph{Configuration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Audience Targeting} $\rightarrow$\emph{Campaigns}. To
create a new campaign, you need to select a user segment to target, a
start date and an end date, and a priority, as well as a name and,
optionally, a description. You also have to indicate whether or not the
campaign you create should be active or inactive. When you've entered
the required information, click \emph{Save}. The user segment you select
when creating a campaign represents the portal users targeted by the
campaign. The start and end dates together specify the duration of the
campaign. There can be multiple campaigns active at the same time that
target the same user segment. In these situations, the priority
attribute of the campaigns determines which campaign takes precedence.
Finally, you can activate or deactivate a campaign via the active
attribute of a campaign. Deactivating a campaign disables the effect of
the campaign within the portal. Deactivating a campaign is like deleting
the campaign except that a deactivated campaign can be reactivated
later. It can be useful to deactivate a campaign if a problem is found
with the way content is being displayed. Once the problem has been
corrected, the campaign can be reactivated.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/07-audience-targeting-user-campaigns.png}
\caption{\\Figure 7.5: Click on \emph{Site Administration} →
\emph{Configuration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Audience Targeting} $\rightarrow$\emph{Campaigns} to
manage campaigns for a site.}
\end{figure}

For example, suppose you wanted the ability to display certain content
(for example, advertisements about your new Android app) to female
baseball fans during the months leading up to the World Series. To
achieve this, you could use the Gender rule (configured to female), the
Device Rule (configured for Android devices) and the Score Points rule
to define a user segment called \emph{Female Baseball Fans}. The Score
points rule assigns 1 point to a user each time the user visits a page
or views an asset categorized under the user segment \emph{Female
Baseball Fans}. When a user accumulates a certain number of points
(specified by the value of the Score Points rule's \emph{Score Points
Threshold} attribute), the user matches this rule. After creating this
user segment, you would create a new campaign targeting this segment,
select start and end dates, choose a priority, choose \emph{Active}, and
then click \emph{Save}. To actually present content to the users
belonging to the \emph{Female Baseball Fans} user segment, you need to
use the Campaign Content Display application.

To configure permissions for creating, editing, and deleting campaigns,
visit the Roles section of the Control Panel and search for
\emph{Audience Targeting Resources}.

\subsection{Managing Campaign
Priorities}\label{managing-campaign-priorities}

The priority of your campaigns becomes important when multiple campaigns
are running at the same time on your website. The Campaign Content
Display application can be configured to display content based on the
campaign your users match. When a user matches multiple campaigns, the
one with the highest priority takes precedence.

If you have several Campaign Content Display applications around your
website configured to display different content per campaign, changing
the priority of one campaign automatically affects all the Campaign
Content Display applications. Similarly, if a campaign is deactivated or
if a campaign's date range is exceeded, all of the Campaign Content
Display applications on your website are affected.

\subsection{Defining Tracking Actions}\label{defining-tracking-actions}

One of the most interesting features of campaigns is that they allow you
to measure the effectiveness of a campaign. This provides your marketing
team with real feedback from users. When creating a campaign, you can
define the user actions that you want to track. The Audience Targeting
app can display reports of how often those actions are triggered. For
example, suppose you want to run a campaign for an event that your
company is hosting next month. For this event, imagine that you have
created a main page for the event which contains a Youtube video and a
banner which says ``Register Now''. Imagine also that you have a blog
entry about the event displayed on several different pages of your
website and a Register page which contains the form to pay for the
event. In this campaign, your goal is to get as many people to register
as possible. However, you will probably be interested in tracking the
following information to see if there is something not working as your
team expected:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Visits to the main page of the event
\item
  Clicks to view the video
\item
  Number of users who watched the video until the end
\item
  Clicks on the Register Now banner
\item
  Views of the blog entry about the event
\item
  Views of the Register form
\item
  Number of users who started to fill out the Register form
\item
  Number of users who completed the registration
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/07-audience-targeting-tracking-actions.png}
\caption{\\Figure 7.6: Drag and drop tracking actions to the right to
configure a campaign.}
\end{figure}

You could drag and drop \emph{tracking actions} from the palette to
track all the actions mentioned above. More types of tracking actions
can be created by developers and deployed as OSGI plugins. See the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/extending-the-audience-targeting-application}{Extending
the Audience Targeting Application} tutorial for details.

The tracking actions use an analytics engine called \emph{Audience
Targeting Analytics} that can be configured per site or per portal
instance. To configure the analytics engine per site, go to \emph{Site
Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site Settings}. To configure it per portal
instance, go to \emph{Control Panel} $\rightarrow$\emph{Portal Configuration}.
Tracking all the actions of all your users (even guest users) can be a
very heavy load for your server. Therefore, it's best to disable the
tracking of any actions about which you don't need information.

\subsection{Campaign Reports}\label{campaign-reports}

Reports are available for campaigns. You can click \emph{Actions} →
\emph{Reports} next to a campaign to see the list of reports available.
More reports can be created by developers and deployed as OSGI plugins.
See the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/extending-the-audience-targeting-application}{Extending
the Audience Targeting Application} tutorial for details.

The Content Views report shows the number of times that different assets
have been viewed via the Campaign Content Display application by users
in the context of the current campaign. For example, if you configured
five Campaign Content Display applications around your website to
display content for a campaign, the Content View report for the campaign
would show how many times was that content displayed to different users.

The Tracking Actions report shows the number of times that the actions
tracked by the campaign have been triggered by users. Consider the
example that we introduced earlier in the section on tracking actions:
you've created a campaign for an event that your company will host soon.
For this event, you have created a main page for the event which
contains a Youtube video and a banner which says ``Register Now''. You
also have created a blog post about the event which is displayed on
several different pages of your website. Lastly, you have a Register
page which contains the form to pay for the event. For this example, the
Tracking Actions report would show you how many users visited the event
page, how many watched the video, how many clicked on the banner, how
many viewed the blog post about the event, how many started filling the
registration form, etc. This information helps you measure the
effectiveness of your campaign. You can use this information to evaluate
whether or not the users are following the engagement path you had
prepared.

\section{Using the Audience Targeting
Applications}\label{using-the-audience-targeting-applications}

The Audience Targeting app not only adds the Audience Targeting
application to the Site Administration area of the Control Panel, it
also includes the following instanceable applications which can be added
to any portal page:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  User Segment Content Display
\item
  User Segment Content List
\item
  Campaign Content Display
\end{itemize}

All of these applications support Application Display Templates (ADTs)
so that site administrators can customize the look and feel of the
application. Any of Liferay Portal's out-of-the-box Asset Publisher ADTs
can actually be re-used for these Audience Targeting applications.

\subsection{User Segment Content
Display}\label{user-segment-content-display}

The User Segment Content Display application allows administrators to
specify exactly which content to display to a user based on the user
segments that the user belongs to. You can specify multiple rules
according to the following format:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  If the user {[}belongs\textbar{}does not belong{]} to
  {[}any\textbar{}all{]} of the following user segments {[}specify a
  list of user segments{]}, then display this content: {[}specify a
  specific asset{]}.
\end{itemize}

You can specify any number of \emph{if} clauses when configuring the
User Segment Content Display application's rules. However, an
\emph{otherwise} clause always follows the last \emph{if} clause so that
the application knows what to display if the user doesn't match any user
segments. \emph{Don't display anything} is an option for the
\emph{otherwise} clause.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/user-segment-content-display-config.png}
\caption{\\Figure 7.7: You can configure the User Segment Content Display
application to display content according to rules that you define in the
application's configuration window.}
\end{figure}

For example, you can add a User Segment Content Display application to a
page and configure the following rules for it:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  If the user \emph{belongs} to \emph{any} of the following user
  segments: \emph{Tennis fans}, then display this content:
  \emph{tennis\_picture.jpg}.
\item
  If the user \emph{belongs} to \emph{any} of the following user
  segments: \emph{Basketball fans}, then display this content:
  \emph{basketball\_picture.jpg}.
\item
  If the user \emph{belongs} to \emph{any} of the following user
  segments: \emph{Soccer}, then display this content:
  \emph{soccer\_picture.jpg}.
\item
  Otherwise, \emph{Don't display anything}.
\end{itemize}

Once a User Segment Content Display application has been added to a page
and been configured this way, users (even guest users) will see a
different image based on the user segment to which they belong. The
application won't even be visible to a user if the user doesn't belong
to any of the configured user segments.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/07-audience-targeting-uscd.png}
\caption{\\Figure 7.8: In the User Segment Content Display application,
site administrators can preview the various assets that have been
configured to be displayed to different user segments.}
\end{figure}

The User Segment Content Display application allows site administrators
to preview the various assets that have been configured to be displayed
to different user segments.

\subsection{User Segment Content List}\label{user-segment-content-list}

The User Segment Content List application displays content that has been
categorized for the user segments that match the user segments to which
the current user belongs. For example, suppose that your website has
several assets categorized under the following user segments:
\emph{Tennis fans}, \emph{Soccer fans}, and \emph{Basketball fans}. When
a user that belongs to the Tennis fans user segment views this
application, the application displays a list of assets categorized for
the Tennis fans user segment. If the user belongs to multiple user
segments, then a list of articles that have been categorized for any of
the matching user segments will be shown.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/user-segment-content-list.png}
\caption{\\Figure 7.9: The User Segment Content List application displays
content that matches the user segments which fit the current user. You
can configure the User Segment Content List application to display
assets of any kind or only specific kinds of assets.}
\end{figure}

By default, the User Segment Content List application is configured to
display assets of any type that have been categorized for any user
segment that matches the current user. However, you can configure the
User Segment Content List application to display only assets of specific
types. For example, you can configure the User Segment Content List
application to only display web content articles and documents.

\subsection{Campaign Content Display}\label{campaign-content-display}

The Campaign Content Display application is similar to the User Segment
Content Display application except that instead of displaying an asset
based on the user segments to which a user belongs, it displays an asset
based on the campaigns that a user matches. However, the Campaign
Content Display application's display rules are simpler than those of
the User Segment Content Display application. You can specify multiple
rules for the Campaign Content Display application according to the
following format:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  If the user belongs to this campaign: {[}select a campaign{]}, then
  display this content: {[}specify a specific asset{]}.
\end{itemize}

As with the User Segment Content Display application, you can specify
any number of \emph{if} clauses when configuring the Campaign Content
Display application. An \emph{otherwise} clause always follows the last
\emph{if} clause so the Campaign Content Display application knows what
to display if the user doesn't match any campaigns. These rules cannot
be ordered manually as they can with the User Segment Content Display
application. The order of the rules is based on the priority of the
campaigns.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/campaign-content-display-config.png}
\caption{\\Figure 7.10: The rules for configuring the Campaign Content
Display application to display content are similar to the rules of the
User Segment Content Display application, but simpler.}
\end{figure}

For example, suppose that you've created two campaigns called
\emph{World Cup} and \emph{Stanley Cup}, designed to target users who
are interested in the World Cup of soccer and the Stanley Cup of hockey.
You could add a Campaign Content Display application to a page and
configure it with the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  If the user belongs to this campaign: \emph{World Cup}, then display
  this content: \emph{soccer-jersey.jpg}.
\item
  If the user belongs to this campaign: \emph{Stanley Cup}, then display
  this content: \emph{hockey-jersey.jpg}.
\item
  Otherwise, display this content: \emph{generic-sports-jersey.jpg}
\end{itemize}

Once a Campaign Content Display application has been added to a page and
been configured this way, portal users who match the World Cup campaign
will see a certain image in the application. Users who match the Stanley
cup campaign will see a different image in the application. Users who
don't match either campaign will see the default image. Of course, once
a campaign has ended, no users will match that campaign. Once all
campaigns have ended, all users will see the default image.

The Campaign Content Display application, like the User Segment Content
Display application, allows site administrators to preview the different
assets that will be displayed for different campaigns.

\section{Simulating User Segments and
Campaigns}\label{simulating-user-segments-and-campaigns}

The Audience Targeting app includes a simulator feature. The Audience
Targeting Simulator allows administrators to preview the way portal
pages appear to different users. It does so by allowing site
administrators to modify the matched user segments or campaigns. The
Audience Targeting Simulator is accessible via the Dockbar. The
Simulator icon appears below the Add, Preview, and Edit icons but above
the Edit Controls icon on the left side of the Dockbar. Clicking on the
Simulator icon opens a panel which has two tabs: \emph{User Segments}
and \emph{Campaigns}. By default, the Audience Targeting Simulator is
only visible to site administrators and users with the View permission
for the Audience Targeting Simulator.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} Permissions pertaining to the Audience Targeting
Simulator and other features of the Audience Targeting app can be
granted via the Roles section of the Control Panel. When defining
permissions for a role, go to \emph{Site Administration} →
\emph{Configuration} to find the \emph{Audience Targeting},
\emph{Audience Targeting Resources}, and \emph{Audience Targeting
Simulator} sections.

\end{roundedframe}
The User Segments tab of the Audience Targeting simulator displays a
list of all the user segments matched by the current user as well as all
the user segments not matched by the current user. Any matched user
segment can be unselected and any unmatched user segment can be
selected. This allows site administrators to simulate how the website
would appear to different users. Clicking on the \emph{Simulate} button
makes your website appear to you the way it would appear to the selected
user segments. The simulation continues until you click the \emph{Stop
Simulation} button. This allows site administrators to navigate around
their site as if they were a user that matched the selected user
segments.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{../../images/07-audience-targeting-simulator.png}
\caption{\\Figure 7.11: Audience Targeting Simulator}
\end{figure}

The Campaigns tab of the Content Targeting Simulator displays all
matched campaigns and all unmatched campaigns. It does not offer a
\emph{Simulate} option yet. However, since campaigns target specific
user segments, it's easy to simulate how your site would look if certain
campaigns were matched.

\section{Liferay Audience Targeting
Rules}\label{liferay-audience-targeting-rules}

Rules enable Audience Targeting administrators to define how users are
classified into the user segments they create.

Basically, a rule evaluates if the current user matches or not one or
several conditions. Rules can be configured and combined differently for
each user segment to create a very specific classification algorithm. A
user must match all rules in a user segment to be classified into it.

\subsection{Behavior Rules}\label{behavior-rules}

These rules allow to classify users based on their navigation behavior.

These rules will not work properly if content tracking or page tracking
are not enabled. They can be enabled in Control Panel \textgreater{}
Portal Settings \textgreater{} Audience Targeting Analytics (for portal
level configuration) or in Control Panel \textgreater{} Site Settings
\textgreater{} Audience Targeting Analytics (for site level
configuration).

\subsubsection{Content Visited}\label{content-visited}

Evaluates if the user has visited the selected content.

\subsubsection{Page Visited}\label{page-visited}

Evaluates if the user has visited the selected page.

\subsubsection{Score Points}\label{score-points}

Evaluates if the user has visited any page or content categorized under
this user segment a number of times equals or higher than the configured
threshold.

\subsection{Social Rules}\label{social-rules}

These rules allow you to classify users based on their profiles in
social networks (e.g.Facebook).

These rules will not work properly if login through the specific social
network (Single Sign On) is not enabled and properly configured. Follow
these steps to enable Facebook Sigle Sign on in Liferay:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Sign in to the \href{https://developers.facebook.com}{Facebook
  Developers site} and add a new App. For more information, read the
  Facebook app developer
  guide\footnote{\href{https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/appcenter}{https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/appcenter}}.
  After going through all the steps, you will finally have a new App with an
  Application ID and an Application Secret.
\item
  Log in as a Portal administrator in your Liferay Portal and go to
  Control Panel $\rightarrow$Portal Settings $\rightarrow$Authentication $\rightarrow$Facebook. Check
  Enable and copy your Application ID and Application Secret to their
  respective fields. Finally click Save.
\item
  To verify that the Facebook Single Sign On works properly, sign out
  and then click the Facebook option in the Sign In box. Enter your
  Facebook username and password in the prompted pop-up and click Login.
  You should be automatically signed in to your Liferay Portal with your
  Facebook user.
\end{enumerate}

Read the Liferay User Guide\footnote{\href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/integrating-existing-users-into-liferay}{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge\_base/6-2/integrating-existing-users-into-liferay}} for more information.

\subsubsection{Facebook Age}\label{facebook-age}

Evaluates if the age in the user's Facebook profile is in the configured
range.

\subsubsection{Facebook City}\label{facebook-city}

Evaluates if the city in the user's Facebook profile matches the
configured value.

\subsubsection{Facebook Education}\label{facebook-education}

Evaluates if the education in the user's Facebook profile matches the
configured values.

\subsubsection{Facebook Friends}\label{facebook-friends}

Evaluates if the user has more or less friends in Facebook than the
selected value.

\subsubsection{Facebook Gender}\label{facebook-gender}

Evaluates if the gender in the user's Facebook profile matches the
selected value.

\subsubsection{Facebook Page Like}\label{facebook-page-like}

Evaluates if the user likes the configured Facebook page.

\subsection{User Attributes Rules}\label{user-attributes-rules}

These rules allow to classify users based on the attributes.

These rules will not work properly if the corresponding attributes are
not available. Follow the given instructions for each rules in such
cases.

\subsubsection{Age}\label{age}

Evaluates if the age in the user's profile is in the configured range.

\subsubsection{Gender}\label{gender}

Evaluates if the gender in the user's profile matches the selected
value.

\subsubsection{Regular Role}\label{regular-role}

Evaluates if the user has the selected regular role assigned.

\subsubsection{Site Member}\label{site-member}

Evaluates if the user is member of the selected site.

\subsubsection{Site Role}\label{site-role}

Evaluates if the user has the selected role assigned in the selected
site.

\subsubsection{Organization Member}\label{organization-member}

Evaluates if the user is member of the selected organization.

\subsubsection{Organization Role}\label{organization-role}

Evaluates if the user has the selected role assigned in the selected
organization.

\subsubsection{User Group Member}\label{user-group-member}

Evaluates if the user is member of the selected user group.

\subsubsection{User Signed In}\label{user-signed-in}

Evaluates if the user is signed in in the portal.

\subsection{Session Attributes Rules}\label{session-attributes-rules}

These rules allow to classify users based on their session attributes.
Session attributes usually refer to the context in which the user
accesses.

These rules will not work properly if the corresponding session
attributes are retrieved through any tools that are not currently
available or properly configured. Follow the given instructions for each
rules in such cases.

\subsubsection{Browser}\label{browser}

Evaluates if the user is accessing with the selected browser.

\subsubsection{Device}\label{device}

Evaluates if the user is accessing with the selected device.

This rule is based on the existing Device Families. To manage Device
Families go to Site Administration $\rightarrow$Configuration $\rightarrow$Mobile Device
Families.

\subsubsection{Location}\label{location}

Evaluates if the user is accessing from a country and region that match
the configured values.

\subsubsection{Operating System}\label{operating-system}

Evaluates if the user is accessing with the selected Operating System.

\subsubsection{Time}\label{time}

Evaluates if the user is accessing at a time that is within the
configured range.

Notice that the reference time is that of the server.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-7}

In this chapter, we learned how to use Liferay' audience targeting app.
This app allows you to define custom user segments, target specific
content to different user segments, and create campaigns for different
user segments. Liferay's audience targeting app allows you generate
reports so that you can measure the effectiveness of your campaigns.
Liferay's audience targeting app includes a simulator so that you can
preview how your site would appear to users belonging to different user
segments. You can create user segments by applying various rules that
reference session attributes, profile attributes, behavior, and possibly
other information, such as information from social networks. It's also
easy for developers to create additional rules and rule types.

\chapter{Personalization and
Customization}\label{personalization-and-customization}

In this chapter, we discuss several ways Liferay users can customize
pages, applications, and the way they use your portal. We'll cover the
following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Personal Sites
\item
  Customizable Pages and Applications
\item
  Application Display Templates
\item
  Using a Rules Engine
\end{itemize}

Personal sites allow each portal user to manage and customize a set of
public and/or private pages and any associated content or applications.
Public pages provide a means of making content publicly available.
Private pages provide a means for users to create content and use
applications that should be hidden from other users. Liferay 6.1
introduced the concepts of customizable pages and applications.
Administrators can designate certain pages or applications as
``customizable,'' which allows each user to make and save their own
customizations. Portlet layouts can also be customized with the use of
application display templates. Application display templates allow a
portlet's look and feel to be completely customized. Liferay Enterprise
Edition provides a rules engine which allows administrators to create
custom portal rules and simplify complex blocks of code containing lots
of \texttt{if-else} statements. Let's start by discussing personal
sites.

\section{User Personal Sites}\label{user-personal-sites}

By default, newly created users in Liferay are each granted a personal
site. Each user functions as the site administrator of his or her
personal site. Personal sites are fully customizable but cannot have
more than one member. The public pages of personal sites provide a space
for users to add content and applications that they'd like to make
accessible to anyone, including guests. User blogs are often placed on
public personal site pages. Content and applications that users would
like to reserve for personal use are often placed on the private pages
of personal sites. For example, each user can add a Documents and Media
portlet to his or her private pages and use it as an online private file
repository.

If you'd like to disable personal sites for your portal, just add the
following properties to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
layout.user.public.layouts.enabled=false
layout.user.private.layouts.enabled=false
\end{verbatim}

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Note that the public and private page sets of personal sites are handled
separately. You can leave one page set enabled while disabling the
other.
\vspace{22pt}
\end{roundedframe}
What if you initially had user personal sites enabled for your portal
but then disabled them? Each existing user's personal site remains on
your portal until the next time they log in, at which point it's
removed.

You can allow users to create personal sites but not have them
automatically created for new users. To do this, first make sure that
\texttt{layout.user.public.layouts.enabled} and
\texttt{layout.user.private.layouts.enabled} are not set to
\texttt{false}. You don't need to explicitly set them to
\texttt{true}---\texttt{true} is the default. Then add the following
properties to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
layout.user.public.layouts.auto.create=false
layout.user.private.layouts.auto.create=false
\end{verbatim}

If the following properties are all set to
\texttt{true}, which is the default, then users will have personal sites
and public and private pages will be automatically created for new
users. 

\begin{verbatim}
layout.user.public.layouts.enabled
layout.user.private.layouts.enabled
layout.user.public.layouts.auto.create
layout.user.private.layouts.auto.create 
\end{verbatim}

There are number of portal properties you can use to customize
the automatically created pages. You can customize the names of the
default pages, the portlets that appear on the pages, the themes and
layout templates of the default pages, and more. Please refer to the
Default User Public Layouts and Default User Private Layouts sections of
the \texttt{portal.properties} file for details. You can find an HTML
version of the this file here:
\url{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html}.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Prior to Liferay 6.1, administrators could disallow users from being
able to modify the pages and portlets of their personal sites by setting
the following properties:

\begin{verbatim}
layout.user.public.layouts.modifiable=true
layout.user.private.layouts.modifiable=true
\end{verbatim}

As of Liferay 6.1, this property is obsolete. However, you can customize
the modifiable portions of personal sites through Liferay's permissions
system by removing permissions from roles. To disallow all portal users
from modifying something, remove the relevant permission from the User
role.

\end{roundedframe}
Historically (prior to Liferay 5.1), only power users received personal
sites. Back then, they were called personal communities. If you'd like
only power users to receive personal sites, add the following properties
to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
layout.user.public.layouts.power.user.required=true
layout.user.private.layouts.power.user.required=true
\end{verbatim}

Personal sites are a dynamic feature of Liferay Portal. They allow users
to manage and customize their own pages and content on your portal.
Next, let's look at how users can customize applications.

\section{Page Customizations}\label{page-customizations-1}

Liferay 6.1 introduced the concept of page customizations.
Administrators can designate public pages or sections of public pages to
be customizable. When a user visits such a page, a notification appears
stating that the user can customize the page. Users can make
customizations only in the sections of pages designated by
administrators. Customizations are based on the rows and columns of a
page layout. Page customizations are only visible to the user who made
the customizations. By default, site members can make page
customizations but non-site members and guests can't.

To enable page customizations as an administrator, first navigate to the
page you'd like to let site members modify. Then click on the
\emph{Edit} button at the left side of the page, expand the
\emph{Customization Settings} area, and click on the \emph{Show
Customizable Sections} button.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{../../images/page-customizations.png}
\caption{\\Figure 8.1: To enable page customizations, click on the
\emph{Edit} button at the left side of the page, expand the
\emph{Customization Settings} area, and click on the \emph{Show
Customizable Sections} button.}
\end{figure}

Once you've clicked the \emph{Show Customizable Sections} button, you'll
see one or more red regions, depending on the layout template of your
page. Check one or more of the \emph{Customizable} boxes to allow site
members to customize certain sections of the page. Regions that you've
designated as customizable are colored green.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/customizable-regions.png}
\caption{\\Figure 8.2: Check one or more of the \emph{Customizable} boxes
to allow site members to customize certain sections of the page.}
\end{figure}

When site members visit your customizable page, they'll see a
notification saying, ``You can customize this page.'' Site members can
toggle between viewing their customized page and viewing the default
page by clicking the \emph{View Default Page} or \emph{View My
Customized Page} links just below the Dockbar. There's also a
\emph{Reset My Customizations} link that restores a user's customized
page to the match the default page. This allows users to discard one set
of customizations and start a new set without having to manually undo
each customization that they'd previously made.

Note that non-administrator site members can access the Add menu from
the left side of the screen when viewing their customizable page even if
they don't ordinarily have permission to view this menu. This allows
them to add portlets to the sections of the page that they're allowed to
customize. If they click \emph{View Default Page}, the Add menu will
disappear from the Dockbar since they're not allowed to modify the
default page.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/default-customizable-page.png}
\caption{\\Figure 8.3: Non-administrator site members can customize their
own versions of customizable pages but can't modify the default page.}
\end{figure}

Administrators of customizable pages have the same two views as site
members: the \emph{default page} view and the \emph{customized page}
view. Changes made to the \emph{default page} affect all users, whereas
changes made to the \emph{customized page} affect only the administrator
who made the changes. Changes made by administrators to non-customizable
sections in the \emph{default view} are immediately applied for all
users. However, changes made by administrators to customizable sections
do \emph{not} overwrite users' customizations.

Users can make two kinds of customizations to customizable regions.
First, they can configure portlet applications within the customizable
regions. Second, they can add port\-lets to or remove portlets from the
customizable regions.

The portal doesn't allow users to change a non-instanceable portlet's
configuration inside a customizable region since those kinds of portlets
are tied to the site to which they've been added. If this were allowed,
the customization would affect all users, not just the one who
customized the region. Therefore, changes to the portlet configuration
in a customizable region are only possible for instanceable portlets,
whose portlet configuration only affects that one user.

For example, suppose that you, as an administrator, selected the right
column of the Welcome page of the Lunar Resort site to be customizable.
A member of the Lunar Resort site could take the following steps to make
a personal customization of the Welcome page:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Navigate to the Welcome homepage by clicking \emph{Go To} →
  \emph{Lunar Resort} from the Dockbar.
\item
  Remove the Hello World portlet from the right column of the page.
\item
  Add the Language portlet to the right column of the page by clicking
  \emph{Add}, clicking on \emph{Applications}, searching for
  \emph{Language}, and clicking \emph{Add} next to its name.
\item
  Configure the Language portlet by clicking on the gear icon and
  selecting \emph{Configuration} and then opening the \emph{Display
  Style} dropdown menu and choosing \emph{Select Box}.
\end{enumerate}

The Language portlet is useful to have on your portal's homepage if you
expect users who speak different languages to access your portal. Users
can select their language in the Language portlet to view a translation
of the portal into their native language. After closing the
Configuration dialog box of the Language portlet, the customized Welcome
page looks like this:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/customized-portal-homepage.png}
\caption{\\Figure 8.4: In this example, the user removed the Hello World
portlet, added the Language portlet, and changed the display style from
icons to a select box.}
\end{figure}

To allow users to customize a page, administrators must grant users
permission to \emph{Customize} pages under the Site section. This can be
achieved by assigning permission to a role, then assigning this role to
the appropriate users. For example, if we want any logged user to be
able to customize our customizable pages, we could assign the
\emph{Customize} permission to the role \emph{User}. If we want site
members to be able to customize the customizable pages of their sites,
we would accept the default setting. By default, the \emph{Customize}
permission is assigned to the role \emph{Site Member}.

In addition to granting the ability to customize portlet configurations,
the \emph{Customize} permission allows users to customize the look and
feel of portlets and to import or export portlet settings. Next, let's
look at how to use application display templates.

\section{Using Application Display
Templates}\label{using-application-display-templates}

The application display template (ADT) framework allows portal
administrators to override the default display templates, removing
limitations to the way your site's content is displayed. With ADTs, you
can define custom display templates used to render asset-centric
applications. For example, you may want to show blog entries
horizontally instead of vertically, or list your assets in the asset
publisher portlet in different sizes.

Let's go through a simple use case to illustrate how creating a custom
ADT can improve your site. Suppose you're customizing the Lunar Resort
site and want to allow users to communicate with other interested
travelers. Specifically, you want to configure the Wiki portlet for
collaboration with Facebook or Twitter. With ADTs, you can launch a
template editor, create a custom template, and configure your portlet
host that template. Custom templates let you re-skin your portlet and
give you ultimate control over its appearance and functionality in your
portal.

Before attempting to change the ADT for your application, you'll need to
select a site for your custom template to reside in. Choosing the
\emph{Global} context makes your template available across all sites. To
choose a site to house your ADT, navigate to the Control Panel →
\emph{Sites} and click on a site from the list. If you select the Global
context, the \emph{Application Display Templates} page of the Control
Panel's Configuration Menu shows you a list of sample templates
available for your portlets. These sample templates differ from the
default templates already configured in the portlets. If you choose a
site to host your template, you must create a custom template for that
site's portlets.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/context-selector.png}
\caption{\\Figure 8.5: In the Control Panel, you can choose the context in
which your application display template resides.}
\end{figure}

If you'd like to add an ADT, select the portlet you'd like to customize.
The list below specifies the portlets that can be customized using ADTs.
It also provides sample template descriptions:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{Asset Publisher}: displays abstracts, icons, related assets, and
  print/edit actions for assets. Optionally includes asset bookmarks and
  ratings.
\item
  \emph{Blogs}: displays titles, authors, and abstracts compactly for
  blog entries.
\item
  \emph{Categories Navigation}: displays a column for each vocabulary.
  Each column includes the name of a vocabulary with the vocabulary's
  top level categories listed underneath.
\item
  \emph{Media Gallery}: displays images in a carousel.
\item
  \emph{Site Map}: displays a column for each top level page. Each
  column includes the name of a top level page with the page's immediate
  children listed underneath.
\item
  \emph{Tags Navigation}: displays asset tags colored by popularity: red
  (high), yellow (med\-i\-um), and green (low).
\item
  \emph{Wiki}: displays social bookmarks and ratings for wiki pages and
  their child pages.
\end{itemize}

To create a new ADT, click \emph{Add} and select the template you'd like
to create, based on portlet type. Then enter the name and, optionally, a
description and a small image to use. You can select the language type
for your template (FTL or VM). Lastly, the \emph{Script} option lets you
browse your file system for a template on your file system, or you can
launch the editor and create one directly. On the left side of the
template editor, you'll notice a palette of common variables used for
making templates. This is a great reference when creating your template.
To place one of the variables into the template editor, simply position
your cursor where you want it placed, and click the variable name.

Think it can't get any better? Guess again! If the variable name doesn't
give you enough information on the variable's functionality, you can
hover your pointer over it for a more detailed description. Because
there are multiple kinds of ADTs, there are also different variables for
each ADT. Thus, each template has a different set of variables only
applicable for that specific template.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/adt-script-editor.png}
\caption{\\Figure 8.6: Liferay offers a versatile script editor to
customize your ADT.}
\end{figure}

You can also use the autocomplete feature to add variables to your
template. It can be invoked by typing \emph{\$\{} which opens a
drop-down menu of available variables. By clicking one of the variables,
the editor inserts the variable into the editor.

You also have the ability to embed same-type templates into other
templates. For example, suppose you have an existing Wiki ADT and would
like to create another similar Wiki ADT. Instead of starting from
scratch, you can import the existing Wiki ADT into your new one and
build off of it. In other words, you can utilize ADTs as generic
templates which allow for reusable code to be imported by Velocity or
FreeMarker templates in the system. For more information on how to
create a custom template, visit the Liferay Developer Network.\footnote{\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/application-display-templates}{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge\_base/6-2/application-display-templates}}

Another cool feature is the \emph{Export/Import} functionality. You can
take advantage of this feature by clicking the gear icon at the top
right of the screen and selecting \emph{Export/Import}. For more
information on using this feature, visit the
\href{https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/export-import-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-04-en}{Export/Import}
section of this guide.

After you've completed the initial set up and saved your ADT, you can
manage your ADT through its \emph{Actions} button. This provides several
options:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{Edit}: lets you modify the ADT's setup properties.
\item
  \emph{Permissions}: lets you manage the permissions \emph{Delete},
  \emph{Permissions}, \emph{Update}, and \emph{View} for the ADT.
\item
  \emph{Copy}: creates a copy of the ADT.
\item
  \emph{Delete}: deletes the ADT.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/adt-configuration.png}
\caption{\\Figure 8.7: In the \emph{Configuration} menu of a portlet, you
can edit and manage available ADTs.}
\end{figure}

Additionally, your ADT generates a static URL and a WebDAV URL. These
values access the XML source of your template. You can find these URLs
by clicking the ADT from the menu and expanding the \emph{Details}
section. With the WebDAV URL, site administrators are capable of adding,
browsing, editing, and deleting ADTs on a remote server. If you'd like
to learn more about what the WebDAV URL can do, visit the \emph{Document
Management} chapter's \emph{WebDAV access} chapter.

To enable your ADT for a portlet, navigate to the portlet you want to
modify and open its \emph{Configuration} menu. In the \emph{Display
Settings} sub-tab located within the \emph{Setup} tab, select your ADT
from the \emph{Display Template} drop-down menu. You'll notice they're
separated by context type. Also, you can manage site-specific display
templates for your portlet: do this by clicking the \emph{Manage Display
Templates for {[}SPECIFIC\_SITE{]}} link next to the \emph{Display
Template} drop-down menu. A window will display with a list of your
configured templates only available for your site with options to add
new templates or edit existing templates.

Now that you know the general functions of ADTs, let's create our own.
This brief demonstration will show you just how easy, yet powerful, ADTs
can be for your portal.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Add the Media Gallery portlet to a page by navigating to \emph{Add} →
  \emph{Content and Applications} $\rightarrow$\emph{Applications} $\rightarrow$\emph{Content
  Management} $\rightarrow$\emph{Media Gallery}.
\item
  Select the \emph{Options} gear from the top right corner, then click
  \emph{Configuration}.
\item
  Enable the \emph{Show Actions} and \emph{Show Folder Menu} display
  settings. Then click \emph{Save} and close the popup.
\item
  Click the \emph{Multiple Media} link and select two custom photos to
  display. Then click \emph{Save}, and navigate back to the main portlet
  screen.
\item
  Notice the default format of the pictures. To change the display
  template for this portlet, navigate back to the \emph{Options} gear
  and click \emph{Configuration}.
\item
  From the \emph{Display Template} drop-down menu, select
  \emph{Carousel}. Then click \emph{Save}.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/adt-carousel.png}
  \caption{Figure 8.8: After applying the Carousel ADT, your pictures
  are displayed as a carousel slideshow.}
  \end{figure}

  The Media Gallery portlet is transformed into a carousel slideshow. At
  this time, it's perfectly natural to be experiencing ``I can conquer
  the world'' feelings, just as Liferay's mascot, Ray, exudes in the
  image above. ADTs have that kind of power to transform your site into
  an enjoyable and convenient home for users.
\end{enumerate}

Customizing the user interface of Liferay's bundled portlets provides
the ultimate customization experience for Liferay users. Next, let's
look at how to use Liferay's rules engine.

\clearpage

\section{Using Liferay's rules
engine}\label{using-liferays-rules-engine}

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.25\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/ee-feature-web.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Liferay Portal Enterprise Edition provides an implementation of a JSR-94
compliant rules engine. This rules engine is provided as a Web Plugin
and is based on the popular open source Drools project.

\subsection{Why use a rules engine?}\label{why-use-a-rules-engine}

If you are not familiar with rules engines, you may be wondering why you
would want to use one. In most applications, complex rule processing
often takes the form of nested \texttt{if-else} blocks of code which can
be very difficult to decipher and to maintain. If rules change, a
developer must work with a business user to define the new rules. The
developer must then read through the existing logic to understand what
is happening and make the necessary modifications. The changes must then
be recompiled, tested, and redeployed. A rules engine provides a means
to separate the rules or logic of an application from the remaining
code. Separating these rules provides several distinct advantages.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A rules engine allows for a more declarative style of programming
  where the rules define what is happening, without describing how it is
  happening. This makes it much easier to read than nested `if-else'
  blocks of code. It's also easier to make changes without introducing
  bugs in your code.
\item
  The rules are written in a language that is easier for non-developers
  to understand. This makes it easier for business users to validate and
  even modify the rules without having to involve developers.
\item
  A rules engine allows for changes to be made to the rules without
  requiring that you recompile your application. If your code must pass
  through a strict deployment workflow, this can be a huge time saver
  and can also save a significant amount of money.
\end{itemize}

After all this, you may be interested in using Liferay's rules engine,
so let's get started with it.

\subsection{Installation}\label{installation}

The Drools web plugin is available to Liferay Enterprise Edition
customers through Liferay Marketplace. It's called the Drools EE app and
you'll find it categorized as a Utility app.

The Drools web plugin provides a rules engine implementation. By itself,
it doesn't provide any observable changes to the portal user interface
or any additional functionality. To see the rules engine in action, you
can download and install the Sample Drools portlet that contains two
rule definitions that illustrate how to leverage the rules engine in
your custom code. The Sample Drools portlet is available through the
Customer Portal.

Let's examine the sample portlet to see how it works.

\subsubsection{Configuring the Sample Drools
Portlet}\label{configuring-the-sample-drools-portlet}

Begin by downloading and installing the Sample Drools portlet. The
Sample Drools portlet is available to Liferay Enterprise Edition
customers through the customer portal. The name is
\texttt{sample-drools-portlet}, and you'll find it in the list of web
plugins.

After installation is complete, log in as an administrator and add the
portlet to a page. Initially, the portlet indicates the name of the
currently logged in user and a message stating that there are no
results. To see results in the portlet, we need to create and tag assets
in the site to which you added the portlet.

From the Dockbar, click \emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Content} and create a new
web content instance in your site. Before publishing the web content
instance, tag the article with \emph{americas}. Then, navigate to
\emph{My Account} from the Dockbar and click on the \emph{Addresses}
link on the right side of the screen. Enter a Brazilian, Canadian,
Mexican, or US based address and click \emph{Save}. Navigate back to the
page with the Sample Drools portlet. The Sample Drools portlet should
now be displaying the web content instance that you created.

The default rule that's being evaluated displays a list of assets based
on the current user's address. For example, if the current user's
country is set to Brazil, Canada, Mexico, or the United States, the
Sample Drools portlet displays a list of assets that have been tagged
with the \emph{americas} tag.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sample-drools-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 8.9: By default, the Sample Drools portlet returns
personalized content based on the addresses set on the form for editing
a user account. This form is accessible from the Dockbar via
\emph{{[}User Name{]}} $\rightarrow$\emph{My Account}. Users with addresses in
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, or the United States will see a list of assets
tagged with the ``americas'' tag in the Sample Drools portlet.}
\end{figure}

Now that you've seen how the Sample Drools portlet works, let's take a
look closer at the rules themselves.

\subsubsection{Rules Definitions}\label{rules-definitions}

Rule definitions can be written using Drools' declarative language. Rule
files are text files that often have a \texttt{.drl} extension. A rule
file can contain multiple rules. In addition to the standard Drools'
declarative language, a domain specific language (DSL) can be created
for your specific problem domain. Creating a DSL can make your rules
even easier for business users to create and maintain your applications
rules but does require some additional work up front. For additional
information on creating a DSL for your problem domain please refer to
the Domain Specific Languages section of the official Drools
Documentation.\footnote{\url{http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/5.2.0.Final/drools-expert-docs/html/ch05.html\#d0e6217}}

To see examples of a rules definition file, access the following
directory in the Sample Drools portlet:

\begin{verbatim}
sample-drools-portlet/WEB-INF/src/com/liferay/sampledrools/dependencies
\end{verbatim}

To see how rules work in action, look at the rule defined in
\texttt{rules\_us\-er\_ad\-dress\_con\-tent.drl}.

At first glance, this \texttt{.drl} file looks a lot like a Java class
file. This example starts with a comment describing the rule. Single
line comments can begin with either a \texttt{*\#*} or \texttt{*//*} and
multi-line comments begin with \texttt{\_/*\_} and end with
\texttt{\_*/\_}.

\begin{verbatim}
##
## Rules
##
## This sample program will return personalized content based on the user's
## addresses set in the My Account section of the Control Panel.
##
## For example, suppose the current user has an address in the United States and
## is a member of the Liferay site. All assets within the Liferay site
## that are tagged with "West Coast Symposium" will be returned.
##
\end{verbatim}

Following the comments is a \texttt{package} declaration. The package
declaration is optional in a Drools, but if it appears, it must be at
the beginning of the file. The package denotes a collection of rules.
Unlike Java, the package name does not represent a folder structure;
it's only a unique namespace. The \texttt{;} at the end of the package
declaration and all other statements is optional.

\begin{verbatim}
package com.liferay.sampledrools.dependencies;
\end{verbatim}

After the package declaration are a series of \texttt{import}
statements. Import statements in the rule file are used just like the
import statements in Java classes. Classes that are imported can be used
in the rules.

\begin{verbatim}
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.BooleanClause;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.BooleanClauseOccur;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.BooleanClauseFactoryUtil;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.BooleanQuery;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.BooleanQueryFactoryUtil;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.Document;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.FacetedSearcher;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.Field;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.Hits;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.Indexer;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.SearchContext;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.AssetEntriesFacet;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.Facet;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.ScopeFacet;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.GetterUtil;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.KeyValuePair;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.LocaleUtil;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.StringUtil;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.Validator;
import com.liferay.portal.model.Address;
import com.liferay.portal.model.Group;
import com.liferay.portal.model.Contact;
import com.liferay.portal.model.User;
import com.liferay.portal.service.AddressLocalServiceUtil;
import com.liferay.portal.util.PortalUtil;
import com.liferay.portlet.asset.model.AssetEntry;
import com.liferay.portlet.asset.service.AssetEntryLocalServiceUtil;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
\end{verbatim}

The next line declares the \texttt{dialect} for the package. In this
case, we will be using Java for any of the code expressions that we'll
encounter. The other possible value for the dialect is \texttt{MVEL},
which is a powerful expression language for Java-based applications. See
\url{http://mvel.codehaus.org/} for details. If necessary, the dialect
can also be specified at the rule level to override the package level
dialect.

\begin{verbatim}
    dialect "java"
\end{verbatim}

In this rule file, we have only a single function, which is listed next.
Functions allow you to insert Java code that can be evaluated at run
time into your rule file. Functions are commonly used as a as part of
the consequence clause of the rule statement. Functions are similar to
Java methods but you use the \emph{function} keyword to define a
function. The function's parameters and the return type are declared as
they would be in a Java method. In this example, the
\texttt{getAssetEntries} function returns a \texttt{java.util.List}
object that contains \texttt{AssetEntry} objects based on the
\texttt{user}, \texttt{classNameId}s, and \texttt{assetTagName} provided
in the function call.

\begin{verbatim}
function List getAssetEntries(
    User user, long[] classNameIds, String assetTagName) {

    List<Group> groups = user.getMySites();

    long[] groupIds = new long[groups.size()];

    for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
        Group group = groups.get(i);

        groupIds[i] = group.getGroupId();
    }

    if ((classNameIds == null) || (classNameIds.length == 0) ||
        (groupIds.length == 0) || Validator.isNull(assetTagName)) {

        return Collections.emptyList();
    }

    SearchContext searchContext = new SearchContext();

    Facet assetEntriesFacet = new AssetEntriesFacet(searchContext);

    assetEntriesFacet.setStatic(true);

    searchContext.addFacet(assetEntriesFacet);

    Facet scopeFacet = new ScopeFacet(searchContext);

    scopeFacet.setStatic(true);

    searchContext.addFacet(scopeFacet);

    searchContext.setAttribute("paginationType", "regular");
    searchContext.setCompanyId(user.getCompanyId());
    searchContext.setGroupIds(groupIds);
    searchContext.setIncludeStagingGroups(false);
    searchContext.setScopeStrict(false);
    searchContext.setUserId(user.getUserId());

    BooleanQuery booleanQuery = BooleanQueryFactoryUtil.create(searchContext);

    booleanQuery.addExactTerm(Field.ASSET_TAG_NAMES, assetTagName);

    BooleanClause booleanClause = BooleanClauseFactoryUtil.create(
        searchContext, booleanQuery, BooleanClauseOccur.MUST.getName());

    searchContext.setBooleanClauses(new BooleanClause[] {booleanClause});

    List<AssetEntry> assetEntries = new ArrayList<AssetEntry>();

    Indexer indexer = FacetedSearcher.getInstance();

    Hits hits = indexer.search(searchContext);

    for (int i = 0; i < hits.getDocs().length; i++) {
        Document document = hits.doc(i);

        String entryClassName = document.get(Field.ENTRY_CLASS_NAME);

        long entryClassPK = GetterUtil.getLong(
            document.get(Field.ENTRY_CLASS_PK));
        long rootEntryClassPK = GetterUtil.getLong(
            document.get(Field.ROOT_ENTRY_CLASS_PK));

        if (rootEntryClassPK > 0) {
            entryClassPK = rootEntryClassPK;
        }

        AssetEntry assetEntry = AssetEntryLocalServiceUtil.fetchEntry(
            entryClassName, entryClassPK);

        if (assetEntry != null) {
            assetEntries.add(assetEntry);
        }
    }

    return assetEntries;
}
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively, this function could've been written in a helper class and
then imported using a \emph{function import}. So if we had created a
helper class called \texttt{AddressContentHelper} the import would look
like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    import function
    com.liferay.sampledrools.dependencies.AddressContentHelper.getAsetEntries;
\end{verbatim}

The last section of the rules file contains the actual rules. The syntax
of a rule is very straightforward.

\begin{verbatim}
    rule "name" attribute when condition then consequence end
\end{verbatim}

The rule name is required and it must be unique within the package as
declared above. Names with spaces must be enclosed in double quotes. It
is considered a best practice to always enclose your rule names in
double quotes.

\begin{verbatim}
    rule "Initialize Rules"
\end{verbatim}

The attributes section is optional. In our first rule, we have a single
attribute called \texttt{salience}. The salience attribute is an integer
value that acts as a priority weighting. The number can be positive or
negative and defaults to the value of \texttt{0}. Rules with a higher
salience value are given a higher priority. It is considered a best
practice to write attributes one to a line. In our example, the first
rule is one that should be evaluated before any other so it is given a
high salience value of 1000. None of our other rules have a salience
attribute set, so they all default to a value of \texttt{0}.

\begin{verbatim}
    salience 1000
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{when} keyword marks the conditional section of the rule. It
is also referred to as the Left Hand Side (LHS). The \texttt{when}
keyword is followed by zero or more condition elements that must be met
before the consequence will be called. If there are no condition
elements, then the condition is always evaluated as true.

The most common type of conditional element is a \emph{pattern}.
Patterns match against \emph{facts}. Facts are statements that are known
to be true. Facts can be inserted by the Java code that invokes the
rules engine or they can be declared in the rule file itself.

In the first rule of our rule file (\texttt{Initialize Rules}), the only
condition is that the rule must operate on a User object.

\begin{verbatim}
when user : User();
\end{verbatim}

In more complex rules, the pattern may include constraints or may
evaluate the properties of Java objects. For example, the second rule of
this rule file is called \emph{Get European Content}. This rule includes
the following pattern which ensures that a user's address contains the
country name France, Germany, or Spain.

\begin{verbatim}
userAddress : Address(country.getName(Locale.US) in ("France", "Germany", "Spain"));
\end{verbatim}

The consequence section of the rule follows the conditional section.
It's also known as the Right Hand Side (RHS) or action part of the rule.
The consequence section begins with the keyword \texttt{then} and it is
intended to modify the working memory data. Drools provides some
convenience methods that make it easier to modify the working memory. In
this rule, we use the \texttt{insertLogical} method which places a new
object into the working memory and retracts it when there are no more
facts supporting the truth of the current rule. After the consequence
section of the rule, the rule is terminated with the keyword
\texttt{end}.

\begin{verbatim}
then List<Address> userAddresses = AddressLocalServiceUtil.getAddresses(
        user.getCompanyId(), Contact.class.getName(), user.getContactId());

    for (Address userAddress : userAddresses) {
        insertLogical(userAddress); } end
\end{verbatim}

Following the initial rule in our example, there are three additional
rules that will be evaluated. Each of these rules evaluates the
\texttt{userAddress} that was inserted into the working memory to
determine what type of content should be displayed to the end user.

For additional documentation on the Drools rules language, please see
the official Drools documentation.\footnote{\url{http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/5.2.0.Final/drools-expert-docs/html/}}

\section{Summary}\label{summary-8}

In this chapter, we discussed personal sites for portal users. We showed
how to enable or disable them, how to set whether or not pages should be
automatically created, and how to customize automatically created pages.
We also examined general customizable pages that don't belong to
personal sites. Administrators can designate certain pages or portions
of pages to be customizable and site members can configure these
portions of the pages, add or remove portlet applications, and save
their configurations.

We also discussed how you can use Liferay's rules engine with Liferay
EE. As you can see from the Sample Rules portlet, using a rules engine
can be a powerful way to decouple the rules of your application from the
front-end and back-end code. These rules are written in a declarative
language that business users can read and verify. Additionally, rule
definitions can be modified without modifying the underlying Java code,
re-compiling, or redeploying your applications.

\chapter{Collaboration Suite}\label{collaboration-suite}

Liferay Portal ships with a robust suite of collaboration applications
which you can use to build communities of users for your site. These
applications provide all the features that you would expect of
standalone versions outside of a portal setting. The difference with
Liferay's collaboration suite, however, is that all of the applications
share a common look and feel, security model, and architecture. They
inherit the strengths of being part of Liferay's development platform so
you can use them in combination with Liferay's user management and
content management features to build a well-integrated, feature-rich web
site.

This chapter focuses on how to use Liferay's collaboration suite. We
explain how to set up and administer:

\end{itemize}

Let's jump right in and begin by exploring Blogs.

\section{Expressing Yourself Using
Blogs}\label{expressing-yourself-using-blogs}

The word \emph{Blog} is an apostrophe-less contraction of the two words
\emph{web} and \emph{log}. Blogs were first popularized by web sites
such as Slashdot (\url{http://slashdot.org}) which have the format of a
running list of entries to which users could attach comments. Over time,
more and more sites such as Digg, del.icio.us, and Newsvine adopted the
format, empowering users to share their opinions and generating lively
discussions.

Over the course of time, blogging sites and applications began to
appear, such as blogger.com, blogspot.com. TypePad, WordPress, and Web
Roller. These applications allow \emph{individuals} to run their own web
sites in the same format: a running list of short articles to which
readers who are registered with the site can attach threaded comments.
People who run a blog are called \emph{bloggers}, and sometimes they
build a whole community of readers who are interested in their blog
posts. Anyone can have a blog, in fact, there are several famous people
who run their own blogs. It gives people an outlet for self-expression
that they would not otherwise have, and the ubiquity and wide reach of
the Internet ensures that if you have something important and
interesting to say, somebody will read it.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-slashdot.jpg}
\caption{\\Figure 9.1: Slashdot was one of the first blogs on the
Internet.}
\end{figure}

Liferay Portal has a Blogs portlet which allows you to provide a
blogging service to users of your web site. In fact, Liferay extensively
uses the Blogs portlet on \url{http://www.liferay.com/community/blogs}
to provide community members and employees with blogs of their own. In
addition to the Blogs portlet, there's also a Blogs Aggregator portlet
which can take entries from multiple users' blogs and put them all in
one larger list. We will go over how to use both of these portlets to
create a blogging site for your users.

\subsection{The Blogs Portlet}\label{the-blogs-portlet}

The Blogs portlet is available from the \emph{Collaboration} section of
the \emph{Add $\rightarrow$Applications} menu. Notice that it is an instanceable
portlet, meaning that it supports scopes. This allows you to use the
Blogs portlet to create a shared blog to build a site like Slashdot or
to create multiple personal blogs to build a site like
\url{http://blogger.com}. What's the difference? Adding the Blogs
portlet to a site page creates a shared blog for members of the site
that the page belongs to. Adding the Blogs portlet to a user's personal
site creates a blog just for that user. The Blogs portlet works the same
way in both cases. And of course, you can change the Blog portlet's
scope to have different blogs on different pages in the same site.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-initial-view-blogs-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.2: The initial view of the Blogs portlet.}
\end{figure}

By default, the Blogs portlet displays the latest entry in its entirety.
When you first add the portlet to a page, it has no entries, so the
portlet is empty. There are several display options to let you configure
it to look the way you want it to look. Before we start adding entries,
let's configure the portlet so that it displays entries the way you want
them.

\subsubsection{Configuring the Blogs
Portlet}\label{configuring-the-blogs-portlet}

The Blogs portlet is easy to configure. Click on the \emph{Options} icon
in the portlet's title bar and select \emph{Configuration}. Beneath the
Setup tab, there is another row of options.

\textbf{Display Settings:} changes various display options for the Blogs
portlet. To choose the right settings, you should think about the best
way to display your entries as well as how you want users to interact
with bloggers.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Maximum Items to Display:} choose the total number of blog
  entries to display on the initial page. You can select up to one
  hundred to be displayed.
\item
  \emph{Display Template:} choose between \emph{Full Content},
  \emph{Abstract}, or \emph{Title}. Setting this to Abstract shows the
  abstract, or if there isn't one, only the first 30 words of your blog
  entries, with a Read More link at the bottom of each that expands to
  the whole entry. To learn how to customize your own display templates
  visit the \emph{Using application display templates} section of the
  \emph{Personalization and Customization} chapter.
\item
  \emph{Enable Flags:} flag content as inappropriate and send an email
  to the administrators.
\item
  \emph{Enable Related Assets:} select related content from other
  portlets to pull into their blog entry for readers to view.
\item
  \emph{Enable Ratings:} lets readers rate your blog entries from one to
  five stars.
\item
  \emph{Enable Comments:} lets readers comment on your blog entries.
\item
  \emph{Enable Comment Ratings:} lets readers rate the comments which
  are posted to your blog entries.
\item
  \emph{Enable Social Bookmarks:} lets users tweet, Facebook like, or +1
  (Google Plus) about blog posts. You can edit which social bookmarks
  are available in the \emph{Social Bookmarks} section of the
  Configuration menu.
\item
  \emph{Display Style:} select a simple, vertical, or horizontal display
  style for your blog posts.
\item
  \emph{Display Position:} choose a top or bottom position for your blog
  posts.
\item
  \emph{Social Bookmarks:} choose social bookmarks to enable for blog
  posts, which includes Twitter, Facebook, and plusone (Google Plus).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-blogs-configuration.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.3: The Blogs portlet's \emph{Configuration} menu
offers a plethora of display settings.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Email From:} defines the \emph{From} field in the email messages
that users receive from the Blogs portlet.

\textbf{Entry Added Email:} defines a subject and body for the emails
sent out when a new Blog entry has been added.

\textbf{Entry Updated Email:} defines a subject and body for the emails
sent out when a new Blog entry has been updated.

\textbf{RSS:} choose how blogs are displayed to RSS readers. Here, you
can choose how you want your blog entries to be published as feeds to
readers and outside web sites.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Maximum Items to Display:} choose the total number of RSS feeds
  to display on the initial page. You can choose up to one hundred to be
  displayed.
\item
  \emph{Display Style:} choose between \emph{Full Content},
  \emph{Abstract}, and \emph{Title}. These options work just like the
  ones above for blog entries.
\item
  \emph{Format:} choose which format you want to deliver your blogs:
  Atom 1.0, RSS 1.0, or RSS 2.0.
\end{itemize}

Now that you have the Blogs portlet looking the way you want it, you'll
want to review permissions for it--especially if you're working on a
shared blog.

\subsubsection{Permissions}\label{permissions-1}

If you have a personal blog, the default permissions should work well
for you. If you have a shared blog, you may want to modify the
permissions on the blog. The default settings make it so only the owner
of the site to which the portlet has been added is able to add entries.
This, of course, is great if the Blogs portlet has been added to a
user's personal pages, but doesn't work so well for a shared blog. But
don't worry: it's easy to share a blog with multiple users.

First, create a role for your bloggers and add them to the role (roles
are covered in chapter 13). Next, click the \emph{Permissions} button on
the Blogs portlet. A list of both portal and site roles is displayed,
and currently only the owner is checked. Check off any other role or
team that should have the ability to add blog entries, and then click
\emph{Save}. Once this is done, users in the roles or teams that you
selected are able to post to the shared blog.

Now that everyone's able to post, let's look at how posts work.

\subsubsection{Adding Blog Entries}\label{adding-blog-entries}

Now you're ready to begin adding blog entries. Click the \emph{Add Blog
Entry} button. The following data entry screen appears:

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{../../images/05-new-blog-entry.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.4: After clicking \emph{Add Blog Entry}, a new window
appears with configuration options for your new blog entry.}
\end{wrapfigure}

There isn't much difference between this screen and any other data entry
screen within Liferay Portal. You get a title, a way of scheduling when
the entry is to appear, and a rich editor that allows you to format your
entry the way you want, complete with embedded images, videos, and the
like. Note also that as you type, the entry is automatically saved as a
draft at periodic intervals. This gives you peace of mind in using the
portlet from within your browser, since you won't lose your entry in the
event of a browser crash or network interruption. You can also tag your
entries using the same tagging mechanism found everywhere else in the
portal.

The Blogs portlet also supports trackbacks and pingbacks. Trackbacks are
special links that let you notify another site that you explicitly
linked to them in the \emph{Content} field. For example, if you wanted
to write an entry in your blog and reference some other site's entry,
you might put the URL to the other entry in the \emph{Content} field and
the trackback URL in the \emph{Trackbacks Sent} field. If you have
multiple URLs you want to send trackbacks to, separate them with spaces.

If you want others who link to your blog to let you know about the link
via trackbacks, leave the \emph{Allow Trackbacks} box checked. This
generates a URL that is displayed with your blog entry. Others who want
to link to your entry can use this URL for the link, to send trackbacks
to your blog.

Note that trackbacks only work when the protocol is supported by both
the linker and the linkee. A newer way to support similar link
notification functionality is \emph{pingbacks}. Pingbacks are XML-RPC
requests that are similar to trackbacks except they're automatically
sent when you link to another site. They're easier to use because you
don't have to do anything extra: if you link to another site in your
blog entry, Liferay sends a pingback to the other site to notify that
site that you linked to it. Similarly, if someone links to your blog
entry, Liferay can receive a pingback from that person's site and record
the link.

You can enter a description of your post beneath the Abstract heading,
and this can be used by the Abstract display style. Below this is the
Categorization heading, where you can attach tags and/or categories to
your blog entry. You should definitely consider doing this: it improves
search results for blog entries, and it gives you more navigation
options that you can pass on to your users. For example, you can add the
Tags Navigation portlet to another column on your blogs page, allowing
users to browse blog entries by tag.

Below this is the Related Assets heading. If there's some other content
in the portal that's related to your blog, you can choose it here. For
example, you might want to write a blog entry talking about a particular
discussion that happened on the forums. To link those two assets
together, select the forum thread under Related Assets.

Once you've finished your blog entry, click \emph{Publish}. You'll go
back to the list of entries, and now your entry is displayed. Here is
what it looks like when the display template is set to \emph{Full
Content} and the maximum items to display is set to ten:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-first-blog-entry-added.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.5: This sample blog entry gives you an idea of what
new content and features are displayed on your page.}
\end{figure}

You can see that in the summary view, you don't see the
trackback/pingback link, and you only see the number of comments that
have been added. If you were to click the \emph{Read More} link, you
would see the entirety of the article, all the comments in a threaded
view, and the trackback/pingback link which others can use to link back
to your blog entry.

The full view of the blog entry also contains links to share blog
entries on social networks, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus.
This gives your readers an easy way to share blog entries with friends,
potentially driving further traffic to your site. As you can see, the
Blogs portlet is a full-featured blogging application that gives you and
your users the ability to enter the blogosphere with an application that
supports anything a blogger needs.

Of course, Liferay is a portal, and as a portal, it excels at
aggregating information from multiple places. For that reason, it also
includes the Blogs Aggregator portlet so that you can ``bubble up'' blog
entries from multiple users and highlight them on your site. Let's look
next at how that works.

\subsection{Aggregating Blog Entries}\label{aggregating-blog-entries}

You can set up a whole web site devoted just to blogging if you wish.
The Blogs Aggregator portlet allows you to publish entries from multiple
bloggers on one page, giving further visibility to blog entries. This
portlet is also very straightforward to set up. You can add it to a page
from the \emph{Collaboration} category in the \emph{Add $\rightarrow$Applications}
menu.

If you click \emph{Configuration} from the options button in the title
bar of the portlet, the Blogs Aggregator's configuration page appears.
From here, you can set several configuration options.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-blogs-aggregator-configuration.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.6: You can navigate to the Blogs Aggregator
Configuration menu by selecting the \emph{Options} gear from the
portlet's title bar and selecting \emph{Configuration}.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Selection Method:} select Users or Scope here. If you select
Users, the Blogs Aggregator aggregates the entries of every blogger on
your system. If you want to refine the aggregation, you can select an
organization by which to filter the users. If you select Scope, the
Blogs Aggregator contains only entries of users who are in the current
scope. This limits the entries to members of the site where the Blogs
Aggregator portlet resides.

\textbf{Organization:} select which organization's blogs you want to
aggregate.

\textbf{Display Style:} select from several different styles for
displaying blog entries: \emph{Body and Image}, \emph{Body},
\emph{Abstract}, \emph{Abstract without Title}, \emph{Quote},
\emph{Quote without Title}, and \emph{Title}.

\textbf{Maximum Items to Display:} select maximum number of entries the
portlet displays.

\textbf{Enable RSS Subscription:} creates an RSS feed out of the
aggregated entries. This lets users subscribe to an aggregate feed of
all your bloggers. Below this checkbox, you can configure how you want
the RSS Feed displayed:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \textbf{Maximum Items to Display:} select maximum number of RSS items
  to display.
\item
  \textbf{Display Style:} select from several different styles for
  displaying RSS feeds: \emph{Abstract}, \emph{Full Content}, and
  \emph{Title}.
\item
  \textbf{Format:} select which web feed language to use for your feed,
  which includes \emph{Atom 1.0}, \emph{RSS 1.0}, or \emph{RSS 2.0}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Show Tags:} for each entry, displays all the tags associated
with the blogs.

When you've finished setting the options in the portlet, click
\emph{Save}. Then close the dialog box. You'll notice the Blogs
Aggregator looks very much like the Blogs portlet, except that the
entries come from more than one author. This makes it nice and familiar
for your users to navigate.

\subsection{The Blogs Administrator
Portlet}\label{the-blogs-administrator-portlet}

In the Control Panel there's a portlet for managing your site's blog
entries. Most of the time, the Blogs portlet is the only tool you'll
need to manage your blog entries. If, however, you need to massively
delete blog entries, the blogs administrator portlet is the perfect tool
for you.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/04-blogs-administrator.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.7: The Blogs Administrator portlet lets you delete
large sets of blog entries.}
\end{figure}

Note that it's only for batch processing of blog entries; for the full
set of tools for managing blog entries, your best bet is to use the
Blogs portlet. Next, let's look at Liferay's improved Calendar portlet
available from Liferay Marketplace.

\section{Managing Events and Resources with Liferay's Calendar
Portlet}\label{managing-events-and-calendar-resources-with-liferays-calendar-portlet}

As of Liferay 6.2, Liferay no longer includes the core Calendar portlet
that was included in Liferay 6.1 and previous versions. Instead, Liferay
provides a new Calendar portlet on Liferay Marketplace. The new Calendar
portlet upgrades several features of the old Calendar portlet and adds
additional features. The features you're used to from the old Calendar
portlet are still available. You can add events and configure email
notifications. You can use the Calendar portlet as a shared calendar for
an entire site or as a personal calendar. All content created through
the old Calendar is imported automatically by the new Calendar. Some of
the new features include an improved look and feel, more configuration
options, the ability to assign multiple calendars to a site or user, the
concept of calendar resources, and event invitations.

\subsection{Configuring the Calendar
Portlet}\label{configuring-the-calendar-portlet}

Once you've added the new Calendar portlet to a page, open its
configuration dialog box by clicking on the gear icon in the portlet's
title bar and selecting \emph{Configuration}. The Setup tab provides two
sub-tabs of configurable settings: \emph{User Settings} and \emph{RSS}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/new-calendar-configuration.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.8: The Setup $\rightarrow$User Settings tab provides several new
configuration options that weren't available from the old Calendar
portlet.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{User Settings:} On this screen, you can customize your
calendar's default view and settings. You can set the \emph{Time Format}
to \emph{AM/PM} or to \emph{24 Hour}. \emph{AM/PM} is the default; with
this time format, times such as 8AM or 11PM are displayed. With the
\emph{24 Hour} time format, these times are displayed as 08:00 and
21:00. \emph{Default Duration} refers to event duration. When you add a
new event to the calendar, the time you set here specifies how long
events last by default. You can set the \emph{Default View} to
\emph{Day}, \emph{Week}, or \emph{Month}. You can set \emph{Week Starts
On} to \emph{Sunday}, \emph{Monday}, or \emph{Saturday}. For \emph{Time
Zone}, you can either specify a particular time zone like \emph{Pacific
Standard Time} or \emph{China Standard Time} or you can check the
\emph{Use Global Time Zone} box. If you check \emph{Use Global Time
Zone}, your calendar uses the portal-wide time zone that an
administrator can set via \emph{Control Panel} $\rightarrow$\emph{Portal Settings}
$\rightarrow$\emph{Display Settings} $\rightarrow$\emph{Time Zone}.

\textbf{RSS:} You can enable and customize your RSS Subscriptions for
your calendar from this screen. You have the following options:
\emph{Enable RSS Subscription}, \emph{Maximum Items to Display},
\emph{Display Style}, \emph{Format}, and \emph{Time Interval}. These
options are explained in more detail in the Blogs section.

Next, let's look at how to use the new Calendar portlet.

\subsection{Using the Calendar
Portlet}\label{using-the-calendar-portlet}

The first thing you'll notice about Liferay's new Calendar portlet is
its revamped look and feel. There's a monthly mini-calendar which
provides you with an overview of upcoming events. There's also a larger,
more detailed calendar area. You can set the large calendar area to
display a \emph{Day}, \emph{Week}, or \emph{Month} view. The \emph{Day}
view displays a day as a single column, divided into hours and
half-hours. The \emph{Week} view is similar but displays seven days as
seven columns, divided into hours and half-hours. The month view
displays a traditional calendar view with days represented as boxes. In
the previous section, we saw how to configure the default display view
of the calendar.

\subsubsection{Adding New Calendars}\label{adding-new-calendars}

You can add new personal or site calendars from the default view of the
new Calendar portlet and choose which calendar's events to display. To
add a new personal or site calendar, mouse over \emph{My Calendars} or
\emph{Current Site Calendars}, click on the arrow icon, and select
\emph{Add Calendar}. To manage your personal or site calendars, navigate
to the same drop-down menu and select \emph{Manage Calendars}. All users
can manage their personal calendars. By default, only site
administrators can manage site calendars.

On the Manage Calendars screen, you can click \emph{Add Calendar} to
create a new calendar. As usual, you can enter a name and description
for the calendar and configure its permissions. Flag the \emph{Default
Calendar} checkbox if you'd like the new calendar to be the default
calendar. All sites, including personal sites, have a default calendar.
When a calendar is first visited, the events from the default calendar
are displayed. You can customize the events that appear in the main area
of the calendar portlet by clicking on the colored boxes corresponding
to the calendars. When you click on a colored box, its color disappears
and the events of that calendar are no longer displayed. Click on an
uncolored box to view the events of the corresponding calendar.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{../../images/new-calendar-manage-calendars.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.9: You have options to add or manage calendars. Also,
you can toggle the colored boxes beside your calendars to show/hide your
planned events.}
\end{figure}

When adding a calendar, you can also specify whether or not to enable
comments and ratings for your calendar's events. Comments and ratings
can be enabled/disabled on a per calendar basis. They are disabled by
default. Additionally, you can specify a color for your calendar. Events
created in the new calendar will default to the color you choose.

You can edit a calendar to change its name, description, or color. You
can also change the calendar's default calendar status and flag or
unflag the \emph{Enable Comments} and \emph{Enable Ratings} checkboxes
to enable or disable comments and ratings for a calendar's events.

\subsubsection{Adding Events to a
Calendar}\label{adding-events-to-a-calendar}

It's very easy to add events to a calendar: just click on any day of the
calendar and you'll see an event creation popup appear. If you've
selected the \emph{Day} or \emph{Month} view, you can click on the
specific time when your event begins.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/new-calendar-event-popup.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.10: When you click anywhere on the calendar, you'll
see the event creation popup appear. Click \emph{Edit} to specify
details for your event.}
\end{figure}

In the new event popup, you can select the calendar in which you'd like
to create the new event. This is useful since sites and users can have
multiple calendars. You can click \emph{Save} to create the event right
away or you can click \emph{Edit} to specify more event information.

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/new-calendar-event-details.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.11: You can specify event details such as the event
title, start date, end date, description, location, and more.}
\end{wrapfigure}

The \emph{Title} you enter determines the name of the event as it's
displayed on the calendar. The \emph{Start Date} and \emph{End Date}
times determine when your event takes place. You can click on the date
text box to change the day and you can specify times by selecting a
particular hour and minute of the day. Note: Even though the \emph{Day}
and \emph{Week} views of the calendar break days into hours and
half-hours and display events in these time-slots, that's just for
convenience. You're free to specify whatever start times and end times
you like, such as 11:37am and 12:08pm. Check the \emph{All Day} box if
your event lasts for an entire day. Check the \emph{Repeat} box if your
event takes place over multiple days. Checking this box opens another
popup.

In the Details collapsible section, you can specify four pieces of
information. Under \emph{Calendar}, you can select the calendar to which
you'd like to add your event. Remember that sites and users can have
multiple calendars. Under \emph{Description}, you can explain the
purpose of your event and add any details that you think might be
useful. Use the \emph{Location} field to specify where your event takes
place. Lastly, the \emph{Viewable by} field lets you set the permissions
for your calendar.

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../../images/new-calendar-event-repeat.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.12: The \emph{Repeat} box allows you to specify
whether an events repeats daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly, how often
it repeats, and when (or if) it ends.}
\vspace{-14pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

For more advanced permissions options, select the \emph{More Options}
link. A list of roles for which you can permission appears in the left
column. The other columns represent permissions which can be configured
for the event:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Add Discussion
\item
  Delete Discussion
\item
  Permissions
\item
  Update Discussion
\end{itemize}

\emph{Discussions} refers to comments on the event. So the Add
Discussion, Delete Discussion, and Update Discussion permissions
determine whether a role can add, delete, or update a comment on an
event. The Permissions permission determines whether a role can update
an event's permissions.

In the Invitations collapsible section, you can invite users,
organizations, or other calendar resources to an event. To invite a
user, group, or resource, start typing the name of the entity you'd like
to invite and a list of matches will appear. Select the one you want or
hit \emph{Enter} if the entity you'd like to invite is at the top of the
list. All the entities you've invited to your event appear as a list
under the \emph{Pending} heading, which shows how many pending
invitations there are. If you accidentally invited the wrong entity,
mouse over its name in the \emph{Pending} list, click on the arrow icon
that appears, and click \emph{Remove}. If you'd just like to check the
status of a resource, click on \emph{Check Availability} instead. When
you click on \emph{Check Availability} for a calendar resource, its
schedule is displayed in this calendar view. If you like to overview the
availability of all the invited entities, just click on \emph{Resources
Availability}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/new-calendar-event-invitations.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.13: You can invite users, organizations, or other
calendar resources to your event and can check their availability in a
calendar view.}
\end{figure}

The Reminders collapsible section lets you specify up to two times when
event reminder notifications will be sent via email. For example, you
might like event notifications to be send one day and one hour before
your event. Email is currently the only supported event notification
type. To avoid confusion, the event time in notification emails is shown
in the user's time zone, and the time zone is also displayed. Of course,
Liferay can only calculate this properly if both the portal's and the
user's time zones are set correctly. Users should set this for
themselves when they create accounts. To set the portal's time zone, see
the section \emph{Configuring Additional Portal Settings} in chapter 17.

The Categorization and Related Assets collapsible sections let you tag
the event and select related assets, respectively. By tagging your
event, it will come up in searches related to that specified tag. In
addition, related assets including blogs, message boards, web content,
calendar, bookmarks, wikis, and documents can be selected to include
with your calendar event. When you're done specifying event details,
click \emph{Save}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{../../images/new-calendar-configuration2.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.14: The \emph{Calendar Settings} $\rightarrow$\emph{Notification
Templates} tab lets you customize the email templates for emails that
are automatically sent out to remind users of upcoming events or invite
users to new events.}
\end{figure}

Liferay's Calendar portlet supports social activities. Whenever a
calendar event is added or updated, a corresponding social activity
notification is created. If the event was added or updated in a calendar
that the current user has permission to view, the social activity will
be viewable in the Activities portlet. If the Social Networking portlets
have been installed (they're available as an app on Liferay Marketplace;
search for \emph{Social Networking CE} or \emph{Social Networking EE}),
the social networking notifications will also appear in all the
appropriate portlets, such as the Friends' Activities or Members'
Activities portlets.

Calendar administrators can customize the email notification templates
for event invitation and event reminder emails. To customize a
calendar's email templates, open the calendar's Calendar Settings window
by clicking on the small arrow next to the calendar's name in the
default view of the calendar portlet and selecting \emph{Calendar
Settings}. By default, the General tab of the Calendar Settings appears,
where you can edit the calendar's name, description, color, default
calendar status, and whether or not calendar events and ratings are
enabled or disabled. Click on \emph{Notification Templates} at the top
of the screen to view a new tab. Then click on either \emph{Invite
Email} or \emph{Reminder Email} to customize event invitation or event
reminder emails. You can customize the name that appears on the sent
emails, the address from which to send the email, the subject, and the
body of the email. As with Liferay's other other email notification
templates (e.g., the Message Boards' notification email templates), a
definition of terms appears below the email body editor. This definition
of terms list specifies variables that you can you can use when
customizing the email template. For example,
\texttt{{[}\$EVENT\_LOCATION\${]}} represents the event location,
\texttt{{[}\$EVENT\_START\_DATE\${]}} represents the event start date,
and \texttt{{[}\$EVENT\_TITLE\${]}} specifies the event title.

To respond to an event invitation, you can click \emph{Accept},
\emph{Maybe}, or \emph{Decline} when viewing the event in the Calendar
portlet. The default event invitation notification emails contain links
to their corresponding events. This allows users easy access to events
in the Calendar portlet so they can respond to event invitations.

\subsubsection{Adding and Using Calendar
Resources}\label{adding-and-using-calendar-resources}

You might be wondering, ``It makes sense to invite users and
organizations to an event, but what about other calendar resources? What
are they used for? How can you add them?'' Good questions. Calendar
resources can represent just about anything that you think might be
important to an event. For example, your department might have a limited
number of rooms and projectors to use for presentations. You can add the
various rooms and projectors as calendar resources and add them to
events. This way, when new events are added, the event organizer can
check the availability of important resources against events that have
already been planned. So, how can you add new calendar resources? You
might have noticed that the new Calendar portlet has two tabs in the
main portlet window: Calendar and Resources. Click on the
\emph{Resources} tab of the portlet to view, edit, add, or delete
resources.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/new-calendar-resources.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.15: Click on the \emph{Resources} tab of the portlet
to view, edit, add, or delete resources.}
\end{figure}

Click on the \emph{Add Resource} button to add a new calendar resource.
You'll be able to enter a name and description for your resource,
specify whether or not it should be active, apply tags and categories,
and configure its permissions.

Once you've created a calendar resource, you can click on the
\emph{Actions} button next to it and select one of the following four
options: \emph{Edit}, \emph{Permissions}, \emph{Delete}, or \emph{View
Calendars}. The \emph{View Calendars} option exists since calendar
resources, like sites and users, can have more than one calendar
associated with them. Click \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{View Calendars} and
then click on \emph{Add Calendar} to add a new calendar in which the
selected calendar resource appears.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{../../images/new-calendar-resource-calendars2.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.16: Click on \emph{Add Calendar} to add a new calendar
in which the selected calendar resource appears.}
\end{figure}

Liferay's new Calendar portlet provides an easy-to-use scheduling tool.
Sites and users can have multiple calendars, calendar events can include
calendar resources and calendar resources have their own schedules of
availability. We hope this flexible system meets the needs of your
organization.

\subsubsection{Exporting and Importing Calendar
Data}\label{exporting-and-importing-calendar-data}

Liferay's Calendar portlet allows data to be exported or imported as LAR
files. Both calendar events and resources can be exported or imported.
As with all LAR files, data can only be imported into a version of
Liferay that's the same as the one from which it was exported. To access
the interface for exporting or importing calendar data, click on the
\emph{gear} icon in the portlet header and select \emph{Export /
Import}. By default, the Export tab appears which allows you to define a
new export process or use an existing one to export calendar data. If
you'd like to import data, click on \emph{Import}. You'll be able to
define a new import process by selecting an existing LAR file or by
using an existing import process.

To define a new export process, you first have to choose a name for the
LAR file to be generated. \texttt{Calendar-201308061558.portlet.lar} is
an example of a typical Calendar portlet LAR filename. Notice that by
default, a timestamp is included in the LAR filename. First you have the
option of including the Configuration of your calendar in the LAR file.
Next, you have to define a data range. You can select \emph{All} to
export calendar data regardless of when it was created or last modified.
Alternatively, you can specify a data range. In this case, only calendar
data which was created or modified at or after the start date and before
the end date will be exported. Next, you can choose which kinds of
calendar data to export: calendar events, resources, or both. For each
selected kind of calendar data, you can choose to export associated
comments, ratings, or both. Finally, you can choose whether or not to
export the permissions defined for the specific Calendar portlet window
from which you're exporting data. Click \emph{Export} to export your
data into a LAR file. You should see a message stating \emph{Your
request completed successfully} and you'll be able to click on the LAR
file's name to download it.

To define a new import process, click on \emph{Import} from the Export /
Import window. Then either drop a LAR file into the box outlined by the
dashed lines or click on the button to browse to and select the LAR file
to import. Once selected, you'll be able to choose whether to import
calendar events, resources, or both and whether to import the comments
and ratings associated with these calendar events and resources. You'll
also be able to choose whether or not to import the permissions for the
Calendar portlet window from the LAR file. Once you've made these
selections, click \emph{Continue} and you'll be able to choose a
strategy for updating data:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The \emph{Mirror} strategy means that all data and content inside the
  imported LAR will be created as new the first time while maintaining a
  reference to source. Subsequent imports from the same source will
  update the entries instead of creating new entries.
\item
  The \emph{Mirror with Overwriting} is the same as the Mirror strategy
  except that if an entry with the same name is found, it is
  overwritten.
\item
  The \emph{Copy as New} strategy means that all data and content inside
  the imported LAR will be created as new entries within the current
  site every time the LAR is imported.
\end{itemize}

You must also specify an option for assigning ownership of the imported
data:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{Use the Original Author} means that authorship of imported
  content will be preserved, if possible. If the original author of the
  imported content is not found, the current user will be assigned as
  the author.
\item
  \emph{Use the Current User as Author} means that the current user will
  be assigned as the author of the imported content regardless of the
  original author.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Upgrading the Calendar
Portlet}\label{upgrading-the-calendar-portlet}

In Liferay 6.1 and previous versions, an older version of the Calendar
portlet was included as one of the core portlets. If you're upgrading
from Liferay 6.1 or a previous version to Liferay 6.2 or a later
version, all the calendar events that existed prior to 6.2 will still be
available after your upgrade. After following
\href{https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/upgrading-liferay-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-18-en}{these}
steps for upgrading Liferay, all you need to do to access previously
added events is deploy the new Calendar portlet. You can browse through
the new Calendar to confirm that the upgrade succeeded: you should be
able to view and edit calendar events that were added via the old
calendar portlet.

The old Calendar portlet included certain calendar event types such as
appointments, birthdays, holidays, and meetings. The new Calendar
portlet doesn't include this explicit notion of event types. However, by
using categories, the upgrade process preserves the functionality
provided by the old Calendar portlet's notion of event types. When
upgrading, the old calendar event types are migrated to categories. The
upgrade creates a vocabulary called \emph{Calendar Event Types} and adds
the old event types as categories in this vocabulary. Upon upgrading,
any calendar events that had one of the old event types receive the
corresponding category from the Calendar Event Types vocabulary instead.

Next, let's look at one of the most widely used applications provided by
Liferay: its message boards.

\section{Discuss, Ask, and Answer Using the Message
Boards}\label{discuss-ask-and-answer-using-the-message-boards}

Liferay's Message Boards portlet is a state of the art forum application
similar to many forums in which you may have participated. The
difference, of course, is that Liferay's message boards can inherit the
abilities of the Liferay development platform to provide an integrated
experience that others cannot match.

There are countless web sites out there where it is clearly evident that
there is no link whatsoever between the main site and the message
boards. In some cases, users are even required to register twice: once
for the main site and once for the message boards. Sometimes it is three
times: for the site, for the message boards, and for the shopping cart.
By providing a message boards portlet along with all of the other
applications, Liferay provides a unique, integrated approach to building
web sites. You can concentrate on building your site while Liferay does
the integration work for you.

The Message Boards portlet offers many configuration options. They are
straightforward to use and are the reason why this portlet is a
full-featured forum application for your web site. To get started, add a
Message Boards portlet to your site. Once it is added, click the
\emph{Options} icon in the portlet's title bar and click
\emph{Configuration}. There are two rows of tabs. The first tab in the
top row is titled \emph{Setup}. This is where you can configure the
application the way you want it to behave on your site.

\subsection{General}\label{general}

The first tab beneath \emph{Setup} is labeled \emph{General}. Here, you
can enable anonymous posting, subscribe by default, flags, ratings, and
thread as question by default. You can also choose whether you want the
message format to be BBcode or HTML and choose how long posts display on
the message board. Anonymous posting, subscribe by default, flags, and
ratings are selected by default and the default message format is
BBcode.

Enabling \emph{Allow Anonymous Posting} allows users without an account
on the system to post messages to your message boards. Whether or not
you you'll want to do this depends on the type of community you are
building. Allowing anonymous posting opens your site to anyone who might
want to spam your forums with unwanted or off topic advertising
messages. For this reason, most of those who implement message boards
turn anonymous posting off by unchecking this box.

Enabling the \emph{Subscribe by Default} option automatically subscribes
users to threads they participate in. Whenever a message in a thread is
added or updated, Liferay sends a notification email to each user who is
subscribed to the thread.

You can set the \emph{Message Format} to either BBCode or HTML. This
determines the markup language of users' actual message board posts.
Different WYSIWYG editors are presented to users depending on which
option is enabled. Both editors have a \emph{Source} button which allows
users to view the underlying BBCode or HTML of a message. Users can
compose messages using either the WYSIWYG or Source view and can switch
between views during message composition by clicking on the
\emph{Source} button.

Enabling \emph{Enable Flags} allows your users to flag content which
they consider to be objectionable. If you are allowing anonymous
posting, you might use flags in combination with it if you have someone
administering your message boards on a day-to-day basis. That way, any
unwanted messages can be flagged by your community, and you can review
those flagged messages and take whatever action is necessary. Using
flags is also a good practice even if you're not allowing anonymous
posting.

Enabling \emph{Enable Ratings} enables your users to give certain posts
a score. This score is used by Liferay Portal's social activity system
to rank your site members by how helpful their contributions are. You
can read more about social activity later in this chapter and in chapter
9.

Enabling the \emph{Thread as Question by Default} option automatically
checks the mark as question box in the new thread window. Threads marked
as questions display the flag ``waiting for an answer.'' Subsequent
replies to the original message can be marked as an answer.

Lastly, you can set the amount of time a post is displayed until it is
taken away. You have options of 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, and 365 days.
After the time has passed, the post is removed from the message board.

\subsection{Email From}\label{email-from}

This tab allows you to configure the name and email address from which
message board email notifications are sent. The default name and email
address are those of the default administrator account: The name is
\texttt{Test Test} and the email address is \texttt{test@life\-ray.com}.
Make sure to update this email address to a valid one that can be
dedicated to notifications.

\subsection{Message Added Email}\label{message-added-email}

This tab allows you to customize the email message that users receive
when a message is added to a topic to which they are subscribed.

\textbf{Enabled:} allows you to turn on the automatic emails to
subscribed users. Uncheck the box to disable the message added emails.

\textbf{Subject:} lets you choose a prefix to be prepended to the
subject line of the email. This is usually done so that users can set up
message filters to filter the notifications to a specific folder in
their email clients.

\textbf{Body:} allows you to write some content that should appear in
the body of the email.

\textbf{Signature:} lets you add some content to appear as the signature
of the email.

Below the fields is a section called \emph{Definition of Terms} which
defines certain variables which you can use in the fields above to
customize the email message. Some of these variables are for the message
board category name, the site name, and more.

\subsection{Message Updated Email}\label{message-updated-email}

The Message Updated Email tab is identical to the Message Added Email
tab, except it defines the email message that users receive whenever a
topic is updated.

\subsection{Thread Priorities}\label{thread-priorities}

You can define custom priorities for message threads on this tab. These
allow administrators to tag certain threads with certain priorities in
order to highlight them for users. By default, three priorities are
defined: Urgent, Sticky, and Announcement. To define a thread priority,
enter its name, a URL to the image icon that represents it, and a
priority number which denotes the order in which that priority should
appear.

There is also a field on this form that allows you to select a localized
language for your priorities. If you need to do this, you can select the
language from the selection box.

\subsection{User Ranks}\label{user-ranks}

On this tab, users can be ranked according to the number of messages
they have posted. You can set up custom ranks here. Defaults have been
provided for you, going from zero messages all the way up to one
thousand.

In addition to ranks, you can also choose labels for certain users to
have displayed in their profiles as shown by the Message Boards
application. These labels correspond to memberships these users have in
your portal. Below are examples of using the label \emph{Moderator}. The
Moderator label in this configuration is applied for anyone who is a
part of any of the Message Boards Administrator groups: the site role,
the organization, the organization role, the regular role, or the user
group. Of course, you probably wouldn't want to create a role,
organization, organization role, site role, and user group all with the
same name in your portal, but you get the idea.

\begin{verbatim}
Moderator=organization:Message Boards Administrator

Moderator=organization-role:Message Boards Administrator

Moderator=regular-role:Message Boards Administrator

Moderator=site-role:Message Boards Administrator

Moderator=user-group:Message Boards Administrator
\end{verbatim}

As you can see, all you need to do is set the rank, the collection type,
and the name of the type. In the example above, anyone who has a site
role, an organization role, a regular role, or is in a user group called
\emph{Message Boards Administrator}, or anyone who is the organization
owner gets the moderator rank.

As with thread priorities, on this tab you can define whether your ranks
are localized in a particular language.

\subsection{RSS}\label{rss}

Message board threads can be published as RSS feeds. This tab allows you
to enable/disable RSS subscriptions and define how the feeds are
generated.

\textbf{Maximum Items to Display:} lets you select the number of items
to display in the feed.

\textbf{Display Style:} lets you select the style. You can publish the
full content, an abstract, or just the title of a thread.

\textbf{Format:} allows you to choose the format: RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, or
Atom 1.0.

\subsection{Permissions}\label{permissions-2}

The default page that the Message Boards portlet displays has three
buttons on it. Click the one labeled \emph{Permissions}. This allows you
to define which roles have the ability to add a category of threads or
to ban abusive users from the message boards. Select the roles and
permissions you want to configure and then click \emph{Save}.

\subsection{Adding Categories}\label{adding-categories}

You are now ready to add categories to your message boards. Click the
\emph{Add Category} button. Enter a name for the category and a
description of the category.

Categories can have different display styles. The available categories
must be set in portal property
\texttt{message.boards.category.display.styles} and the default category
in \texttt{message.boards.category.display.styles.default}. When
creating a new category, you can select the display style you like for
that category. By default, Liferay provides two predefined display
styles, although many more can be easily added:

\textbf{Default:} classic display style for general purpose and
discussions.

\textbf{Question:} designed for discussions in a format of questions and
answers.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-editing-message-board-category.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.17: You have several options when creating a Message
Boards Category.}
\end{figure}

You can add as many categories to your message boards as you wish. As we
saw above, categories can have subcategories. You can add any number of
top-level categories to a message board. You can also edit any category
and add subcategories to an unlimited level. For usability reasons, you
don't want to nest your categories too deep, or your users will have
trouble finding them. You can always add more categories as your message
boards grow. Finally, each category can have any number of threads.

At the bottom of the form for creating or editing a message board
category is a check box for enabling the mailing list function. If don't
want to add a mailing list to the category you're creating, click
\emph{Save} now. You can always edit an existing category to add, edit,
or remove a mailing list.

Also, you may merge with a Parent Category by navigating to a category's
\emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Move} button. From this window, you can enable
the \emph{Merge with Parent Category} check box and click the
\emph{Select} button to choose the parent category.

Once one or more categories have been added to a message board, they
appear in a list on the message board's home. The list displays the
names of the categories and the numbers of subcategories, threads, and
posts in each one. To add a subcategory to category, click on the
category's name in the list and then click the \emph{Add Subcategory}
button. By default, when you click the \emph{Add Subcategory} button,
the form for adding a subcategory is populated with the properties of
the parent category. This includes the parent category's display style
(Default or Question) and mailing list configuration. Of course, you can
change the display style or mailing list configuration of a subcategory
just as with a new category.

Liferay's Message Boards portlet supports two different mechanisms for
sending email notifications: user subscriptions and mailing lists. Let's
discuss user subscriptions first and then mailing lists.

\subsection{User Subscriptions and Mailing
Lists}\label{user-subscriptions-and-mailing-lists}

The first mechanism Liferay uses for sending email notifications is user
subscriptions. Users can subscribe to particular categories and threads.
Liferay uses the message board's configured \emph{Email From} address to
send email notifications to subscribed users whenever a new post is
created or an existing post is updated. Liferay can import email replies
to message board notifications directly into the message board. This is
a very useful features since it allows users to interact on the message
board via email without needing to log in to the portal and view the
message board page directly. However, this feature is not enabled by
default. To enable this feature, add the following line to your
\texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
pop.server.notifications.enabled=true
\end{verbatim}

As this property suggests, Liferay's message boards user subscription
mechanism uses the POP mail protocol. When an email reply to a message
board notification is read by Liferay, the reply is posted to the
message board and then deleted from the mail server. Deleting the
message from the mail server is the POP protocol's default behavior and
Liferay assumes that your POP mail server behaves this way. Most POP
clients offer an option to leave mail on the mail server after it's been
downloaded but you shouldn't exercise this option. If you configure mail
to be left on the mail server, Liferay will repeatedly send copies of
each retained message along with each new email notification that's sent
to subscribed users.

When enabling message boards to import replies to email notifications,
you should decide whether or not you want to you a mail server subdomain
to handle notifications. By default the following line is set in your
portal properties:

\begin{verbatim}
pop.server.subdomain=events
\end{verbatim}

This property creates a special MX (mail exchange) subdomain to receive
all portal-related email (e.g., events.liferay.com). If you don't want
to use the subdomain approach, you can unset this value to tell Liferay
to use the \emph{Email From} address specified in the portlet
preferences to receive message board notification email replies. For
example, the \emph{Email From} address could be set to
\emph{replies@liferay.com}.

If you don't want to use a mail server subdomain, add the following line
to your \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
pop.server.subdomain=
\end{verbatim}

If you're not using a mail subdomain, Liferay parses the message headers
of emails from the \emph{Email From} address to determine the message
board category and message ID. If you keep the
\texttt{pop.server.subdomain=events} default, the email notification
address takes the following form:
\emph{mb.{[}category\_id{]}{[}message\_id{]}@events.liferay.com}. In
this case, Liferay parses the email address to find the category and
message ID. Parsing the email address is safer than parsing message
headers since different email clients treat message headers differently.
This is why the \texttt{events} subdomain is enabled by default.

Additionally, you can configure the interval on which the
POPNotificationListener runs. The value is set in one minute increments.
The default setting is to check for new mail every minute, but you can
set it to whatever you like:

\begin{verbatim}
pop.server.notifications.interval=1
\end{verbatim}

The second mechanism Liferay uses for sending email notifications is
mailing lists. Any category in a Liferay message board can have its own
mailing list. Liferay's mailing list mechanism, unlike its user
subscription mechanism, supports both the POP and the IMAP protocols.
POP is the default protocol but each message board's mailing list is
configured independently. If you choose the IMAP protocol for a
category's mailing list, make sure to configure the IMAP inbox to delete
messages as they are pulled by the email client that sends messages to
the users on the mailing list. Otherwise, each email message that's
retained on the server will be sent to the mailing list each time
there's a new post or an update in the category.

When a mailing list is enabled for a message board category, Liferay
listens to the specific email inbox that's configured for the mailing
list. Enabling the mailing list function allows users on the mailing
list to simply reply to the notification messages in their email
clients. Liferay pulls the messages from the email inbox it's configured
to listen to and automatically copies those replies to the appropriate
message board thread.

With both user subscriptions and mailing lists, users can reply to
message board notification emails and Liferay imports their replies to
the message board. However, with mailing lists, users reply to the
mailing list and Liferay listens to the specific inbox configured for
the mailing list and copies messages to the appropriate message board
category. With user subscriptions, by default, email replies to message
board notifications are not imported to the message boards. This feature
has to be enabled in your \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file. Once this
feature has been enabled, users can reply to a specific address and have
their replies copied to the message board.

Note: Since any number of sites can use a globally scoped message board,
globally scoped message boards do not support user subscriptions or
mailing lists. Make sure to use a site-scoped or page-scoped message
board if you need user subscriptions or a mailing list with your message
board.

To enable the mailing list functionality for a category, you need a
dedicated email address for the category. Once you click the
\emph{Active} check box, a number of other options appear. When a
mailing list is activated, Liferay imports messages it receives from the
mailing list to the message board. Liferay looks for a Liferay user with
the sender's email address. If the sender isn't a Liferay user and the
\emph{Allow Anonymous Emails} box is unchecked, the message is thrown
away and not posted to the message board. If the \emph{Allow Anonymous
Emails} box is checked, anyone can send email to the message board
category's dedicated email account and Liferay copies the messages to
the message board.

\textbf{Email Address:} lets you enter the email address of the account
that will receive the messages.

Next, there are two sections: \emph{Incoming} and \emph{Outgoing}. These
define the mail settings for receiving mail and for sending mail. The
Incoming tab has the following options:

\textbf{Protocol:} lets you select POP or IMAP.

\textbf{Server Name:} lets you enter the host name of the mail server
you are using.

\textbf{Server Port:} allows you to specify the port on which your mail
service is running.

\textbf{Use a Secure Network Connection:} lets you use an encrypted
connection if your server supports it.

\textbf{User Name:} lets you enter the login name on the mail server.

\textbf{Password:} lets you enter the password for the account on the
server.

\textbf{Read Interval (Minutes):} allows you to specify how often
Liferay will poll the server looking for new messages to post to the
message board.

The Outgoing section has the following options:

\textbf{Email Address:} lets you enter the email address that messages
from this category should come from. If you want your users to be able
to reply to the categories using email, this should be the same address
configured on the \emph{Incoming} tab.

\textbf{Use Custom Outgoing Server:} allows you to use a different mail
server than the one that is configured for the portal. If you check this
box, more options appear.

\textbf{Server Name:} lets you enter the host name of the SMTP mail
server you are using.

\textbf{Server Port:} allows you to specify the port on which your mail
service is running.

\textbf{Use a Secure Network Connection:} allows you to use an encrypted
connection if your server supports it.

\textbf{User Name:} lets you enter the login name on the mail server.

\textbf{Password:} lets you enter the password for the account on the
mail server.

When you're finished configuring the mailing list for your category,
click \emph{Save}.

\subsection{Managing User Subscriptions with the Message Boards
Subscription
Manager}\label{managing-user-subscriptions-with-the-message-boards-subscription-manager}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/message-boards-subscription-manager-control-panel.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.18: To make sure that the Message Boards Subscription
Manager was successfully installed, look for the \emph{Message Boards
Subscription Manager} entry in the Configuration section of Site
Administration.}
\end{wrapfigure}

The Message Boards Subscription Manager is available as an app from
Liferay Marketplace. It allows site administrators to manage the
subscriptions of their site's message board. Without the Message Boards
Subscription Manager, users must manage their own message board
subscriptions. The Message Boards Subscription Manager is available for
both Liferay CE and EE--make sure to select the correct version when
downloading and installing the app. Once installed, the Message Boards
Subscription Manager appears in the Configuration section of Site
Administration.

The subscription manager allows managing the subscriptions of both the
site-scoped message board and the subscriptions of any page-scoped
message boards that may exist within the site. To access the Message
Boards Subscription Manager, navigate to your site's Site Administration
page, select \emph{Configuration}, and click on \emph{Message Boards
Subscription Manager}. You'll see a list of the categories that have
been created within your site's site-scoped message board. Click
\emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{View} next to a category to view the category's
threads in a new browser tab. Click \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Manage
Subscriptions} to view a list of users which can be subscribed or
unsubscribed from the message board category.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/message-boards-subscription-manager.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.19: The Message Board Subscription Manager allows site
administrators to subscribe or unsubscribe selected users from any
category within their site's message board.}
\end{figure}

Click on the \emph{Subscribe} or \emph{Unsubscribe} links next to a
user's name to subscribe or unsubscribe the user from the selected
message board category. Alternatively, you can use the checkboxes to
select a group of users and use the \emph{Subscribe} or
\emph{Unsubscribe} buttons above the list of users to subscribe or
unsubscribe a number of users at once. The Message Boards Subscription
Manager is easy to use but it's a great tool for site administrators who
need to make sure that certain users receive emails from important
message board categories.

\subsection{Using the Message Boards}\label{using-the-message-boards}

Upon seeing Liferay's Message Boards portlet, your users will
immediately recognize that the interface is similar to many other
implementations they've seen before. Message boards are nothing new to
the Internet, and many people have been using them for quite a long
time. For that reason, Liferay's message boards will seem very familiar
to your users.

Threads can be viewed in many ways. At the top of the portlet is a set
of tabs: \emph{Recent posts}, \emph{My Posts}, \emph{My Subscriptions},
and for administrative users, \emph{Statistics} and \emph{Banned Users}.
The Recent Posts tab shows all posts from all categories by date, so you
can keep up on all the most recent discussions in the message boards.
The My Posts tab shows all of the posts for the user that is currently
logged in. This is a convenient way to get back to a previous
conversation in order to retrieve some pertinent information. The My
Subscriptions tab allows a user to manage thread subscriptions. If you
lose interest in a particular topic, you may want to visit this tab and
unsubscribe from a thread.

For administrators, the Statistics tab shows the number of categories,
the number of posts, and the number of participants in your message
boards. It also has a list of who the top posters to your message boards
are. The Banned Users tab shows all of the users who have been banned
from posting on the message boards.

\subsection{Posting New Threads}\label{posting-new-threads}

To post a new thread simply select the \emph{Post New Thread} button.
You will see a message editing form. The body field on this form is
different from that of the other portlets in Liferay. The reason for
this is to support \emph{BBCode}, which is a standard form of markup
used in many message board products. Before BBCode was invented, many
message board products would allow users to enter HTML to format their
messages. This, however, enabled attackers to insert malicious code into
the message board. BBCode was invented to provide users a way of
formatting their messages without allowing them to enter HTML.
Similarly, Liferay supports BBCode in the message boards portlet because
the other editor--which is used for the Content Management System, the
Blogs portlet, and other portlets--produces HTML. This is appropriate
for those other portlets, as they are only used by privileged users, but
it is not appropriate for the message boards. Besides this, many users
of message boards are familiar with BBCode and are used to it, and the
editor that is provided for Liferay's Message Boards portlet makes it
very easy to use.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-editing-message-board-post.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.20: The \emph{Follow the moon} message board post
gives you an idea of what it takes to add a message board message.}
\end{figure}

The message boards editor is quite rich. It supports bold, italicized,
underlined, and crossed-out text, links, images, colors, lists, tables,
alignments, quotation blocks, code blocks, different fonts and font
sizes, and more. There are even a bunch of smiley faces that you can
use.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-emoticons.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.21: Liferay's dynamic editor even includes a wide
range of smiley faces!}
\end{figure}

Users who have Moderator access to the board can modify the priority of
messages. You can also use the editor to quote from messages that you
are replying to, to insert emoticons, to add preformatted text, and
more. Messages that are posted to the message boards are shown by
default in a threaded view so that replies are attached to the proper
parent message. This makes it easy to follow along with conversations.

When viewing a message board thread, users are given several options. At
the top right of the thread are three icons, allowing users to view
threads in a combination view, flat view, or tree view. A combination
view shows the threads at the top as subjects only, with the flat view
underneath. A flat view shows all of the messages in the order in which
they are posted. A tree view shows all of the messages in a threaded
view, so that replies are next to the messages they are replying to.

When viewing a thread, users can click links allowing them to post a new
thread, subscribe to the thread they are viewing, or if they have
administrative access, lock a thread or move a thread to another
category. Subscribing to a thread causes Liferay to send the user an
email whenever a new message is posted to the thread. If you have
enabled the mailing list feature for the category in which the thread
resides, users can simply reply to these messages in order to post back
to the thread, without having to visit your site.

The Message Boards portlet is also highly integrated with Liferay's user
management features. Posts on the message board show users' pictures if
they have uploaded one for themselves, as well as the dates that users
created an ID on your site.

\subsection{Message Board Administrative
Functions}\label{message-board-administrative-functions}

The Message Boards portlet provides for the day to day administration of
the message threads. You may wish to separate this function out by a
role, and then delegate that role to one or more of your users. That
would free you up to concentrate on other areas of your web site. To do
this, you can create a role called Message Board Administrator. This
role can be scoped by the portal, an organization, or a site. If you
have a portal scoped role, members of this role will be able to
administer any Message Boards portlet in the portal. If it is an
organization or site scoped role, members of this role will be able to
administer a Message Boards portlet in only the organization or site
which assigned the role to them.

Go to the Control Panel and create this role. Once it is created, click
\emph{Actions $\rightarrow$Define Permissions}. Click the \emph{Content} drop-down
list. Browse the list until you find the Message Boards portlet and then
click on it. You will then see a screen which allows you to configure
the various permissions on the portlet.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-defining-permissions-message-board-admin-role.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.22: Defining Permissions for the Message Board
Administrators can be done by navigating to \emph{Actions $\rightarrow$Define
Permissions}.}
\end{figure}

Select the permissions you would like message board administrators to
have and then click \emph{Save}. You can add users to this role and they
will inherit the permissions. Message Board administrators can perform
all of the functions we have already presented, including creating and
deleting categories and posting threads. In addition to these, a number
of other functions are available.

\subsubsection{Moving Threads}\label{moving-threads}

Many times a user will post a thread in the wrong category.
Administrators may in this case want to move a thread to the proper
category. This is very easy to do. You can select the \emph{Actions}
menu to the right of the thread and choose \emph{Move}. Or, if you are
already viewing the thread and you have administrative access, there is
a link at the top of the thread labeled \emph{Move Thread}. Click this
link. You will be presented with a simple form which allows you to
select a category to which to move the thread and a check box which
allows you to post a message explaining why the thread was moved. This
message will be posted as a reply to the thread you are moving. When
finished, click the \emph{Move Thread} button and the thread will be
moved.

\subsubsection{Deleting Threads}\label{deleting-threads}

Users with administrative access to the message boards can delete
threads. Sometimes users begin discussing topics that are inappropriate
or that reveal confidential information. In this case, you can simply
delete the thread from the message boards. This is easy to do. First,
view the list of threads. Next to every thread is an \emph{Actions}
button. Click \emph{Actions $\rightarrow$Move to the Recycle Bin} to delete the
thread. This does not prevent users from re-posting the information, so
you may need to be vigilant in deleting threads or consider the next
option.

\subsubsection{Banning Users}\label{banning-users}

Unfortunately, sometimes certain users become abusive. If you wind up
with a user like this, you can certainly make attempts to warn him or
her that the behavior he or she is displaying is unacceptable. If this
does not work, you can ban the user from posting on the message boards.

Again, this is very easy to do. Find any post which was written by the
abusive user. Underneath the user's name/profile picture is a link
called \emph{Ban this User}. Click this link to ban the user from the
message boards.

If after taking this action the user apologizes and agrees to stop his
or her abusive behavior, you can choose to reinstate the user. To do
this, click the \emph{Banned Users} tab at the top of the Message Boards
portlet. This will show a list of all banned users. Find the user in the
list and select \emph{Unban this User}.

\subsubsection{Splitting Threads}\label{splitting-threads}

Sometimes a thread will go on for a while and the discussion completely
changes into something else. In this case, you can split the thread
where the discussion diverges and create a whole new thread for the new
topic. Administrative users will see a \emph{Split Thread} link on each
post. To split the thread, click the link. You will be brought to a form
which allows you to add an explanation post to the split thread. Click
\emph{OK} to split the thread.

\subsubsection{Editing Posts}\label{editing-posts}

Administrative users can edit anyone's posts, not just their own.
Sometimes users will post links to copyrighted material or unsuitable
pictures. You can edit these posts, which allows you to redact
information that should not be posted or to censor profanity that is not
allowed on your message boards.

\subsubsection{Permissions}\label{permissions-3}

Permissions can be set not only on threads, but also on individual
posts. You can choose to limit a particular conversation or a post to
only a select group of people. To do this, click the \emph{Permissions}
link on the post and then select among the \emph{Delete, Permissions,
Subscribe, Update, and View} permissions for the particular role to
which you want to grant particular access. This function can be used,
for example, to allow some privileged users to post on a certain thread,
while others are only allowed to view it. Other combinations of the
above permissions are also possible. Next, let's discuss Liferay's Wiki
portlet.

\section{Working together with the
Wiki}\label{working-together-with-the-wiki}

Liferay's Wiki portlet, like the Message Boards portlet, is a
full-featured wiki application which has all of the features you would
expect in a state of the art wiki. Again, though, it has the benefit of
being able to take advantage of all of the features of the Liferay
platform. As such, it is completely integrated with Liferay's user
management, tagging, and security features.

So, what is a wiki? Basically, a wiki is an application which allows
users to collaboratively build a repository of information. There are,
of course, many implementations of this idea, the most famous of which
is Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a full online encyclopedia developed
collaboratively by users from all over the world, using a wiki. Another
example would be Liferay's wiki, which is used for collaborative
documentation of the Community Edition of Liferay Portal.

A wiki application allows users to create and edit documents and link
them to each other. To accomplish this, a special form of markup is used
which is sometimes called wikitext. Unfortunately, the proliferation of
many different wiki applications resulted in slightly different syntax
for wikitext in the various products, as each new wiki tried to focus on
new features that other wikis did not have. For that reason, a project
called WikiCreole was started. This project resulted in the release of
WikiCreole 1.0 in 2007, which is an attempt to define a standard wiki
markup that all wikis can support.

Rather than define another wikitext syntax, Liferay's Wiki portlet
supports WikiCreole as its syntax. This syntax is a best-of-breed wiki
syntax and should be familiar to users of other wikis. The portlet
provides a handy cheat sheet for the syntax on the page editing form,
with a link to the full documentation if you wish to use some of
WikiCreole's advanced features.

\subsection{Getting Started with the Liferay
Wiki}\label{getting-started-with-the-liferay-wiki}

The Wiki portlet works just like the other portlets developed by
Liferay. Add the portlet to a page using the \emph{Add $\rightarrow$Applications}
menu and then click \emph{Configuration} in the portlet's \emph{Options}
menu in the Wiki portlet's title bar. You'll see some options are likely
to be familiar to you by now such as sharing the application with
websites, Facebook, Google Gadgets, etc. You will also notice that the
communication tab has some additional options not seen in the other
portlets.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-wiki-configuration.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.23: For each of the public parameters in this portlet,
it is possible to ignore the values coming from other portlets or to
read the value from another parameter.}
\end{figure}

The communication tab of the configuration window allows you to
configure communication across portlets, using predefined public render
parameters. From here you can modify six public render parameters:
categoryId, nodeId, nodeName, resetCur, tag, and title. For each
parameter you can:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ignore the values for this parameter that come from other portlets.
  For example, the wiki portlet can be used along with the tags
  navigation portlet. When a user clicks on a tag in the tags navigation
  portlet, the wiki shows a list of pages with that tag. In some cases
  an administrator may want the wiki portlet to always show the front
  page independently of any tag navigation done through other portlets.
  This can be achieved by checking the Ignore check box so that the
  values of the parameter coming from those other portlets are ignored.
\item
  Read the value of a parameter from another portlet. This is an
  advanced but very powerful option that allows portlets to communicate
  without configuring it beforehand. For example, imagine that the wiki
  portlet is used to publish information about certain countries.
  Imagine further that a custom portlet that allows browsing countries
  for administrative reasons was written and placed on the same page. We
  could associate to this second portlet a public render parameter
  called \emph{country} to designate the name of the country. Using this
  procedure, we can cause the wiki to show the information from the
  country being browsed through in the other portlet. You can do this
  here for the wiki by setting the value for the title parameter to be
  read from the country parameter of the other portlet.
\end{itemize}

Once you have set the options the way you want them, click \emph{Save}.

\subsection{Managing Wikis}\label{managing-wikis}

The Wiki portlet can contain many wikis. By default, it contains only
one, called \emph{Main}. To manage Wikis, navigate to your site's
\emph{Site Administration $\rightarrow$Content} page and select \emph{Wiki}. This
page allows you to add, modify, and delete wikis. The Main wiki has
already been added for you.

At the top of this screen is a \emph{Permissions} button. Clicking this
allows you to define which roles have access to create wikis. If you
have created a specific role for creating wikis, you can click the box
in the \emph{Add Node} column and then click \emph{Submit}, and that
role will have access to create new wikis in this portlet.

Clicking the \emph{Add Wiki} button prompts you to enter a name and
description for the new wiki. You can also set up some default
permissions. When you create a new wiki, it appears in a list at the top
of the main page of the Wiki portlet.

Next to each wiki in the list of wiki nodes is an \emph{Actions} button.
This button contains several options:

\textbf{Edit:} lets you edit the name and description of the wiki.

\textbf{Permissions:} lets you define what roles can add attachments to
wiki pages, add pages to the wiki, delete pages, import pages to the
wiki, set permissions on the wiki, subscribe to the wiki, update
existing pages, and view the wiki.

\textbf{Import Pages:} allows you to import data from other wikis. This
lets you migrate off of another wiki which you may be using and use the
Liferay wiki instead. You might wish to do this if you are migrating
your site from a set of disparate applications (i.e.~a separate forum, a
separate wiki, a separate content management system) to Liferay, which
provides all of these features. Currently, MediaWiki is the only wiki
that is supported, but others are likely to be supported in the future.

\textbf{RSS:} opens a new page where you can subscribe to an RSS feed
using Live Bookmarks, Yahoo, or a chosen application from your machine.

\textbf{Subscribe:} allows you to subscribe to a wiki node, and any time
a page is added or updated Liferay will send you an email informing you
what happened.

\textbf{Move to the Recycle Bin:} moves the wiki node to the recycle
bin.

\textbf{View Removed Attachments:} displays attachments that have been
removed from the wiki node.

To go back to your wiki, navigate back to the Wiki portlet you added to
your page. Then click the \emph{Options $\rightarrow$Configuration} button, which
contains several other options which you may have seen on other
portlets.

The \emph{Display Settings} tab gives you several options for how the
wiki should be displayed. \emph{Enable Related Assets}, \emph{Enable
Page Ratings}, \emph{Enable Comments}, and \emph{Enable Comment Ratings}
are similar to the same options in other portlets. They give you the
ability to set how you want users to interact with wiki documents: a
little, a lot, or not at all. The \emph{Display Template} drop-down
option lets you choose the application display template for your
portlet. Below this, you can set which wikis are visible in the Wiki
portlet by default and which are hidden. You might host two wikis on a
given site, exposing one to the public and keeping the other private for
site members.

The \emph{Email From}, \emph{Page Added Email}, and \emph{Page Updated
Email} tabs are similar to the ones for notification email settings for
other portlets, allowing you to customize who wiki emails come from and
the format and text of the email that is sent when a page is added or
updated.

Finally, the Wiki portlet also supports RSS feeds as the other
collaboration portlets do, and you can configure its options in the
\emph{RSS} tab.

\subsection{Adding and Editing Wiki
Pages}\label{adding-and-editing-wiki-pages}

By default, there is one page added to your wiki, called
\emph{FrontPage}. To get started adding data to your wiki, click the
\emph{Edit} link. You will be brought to a blank editing page.

You can now begin to add content to the page. Notice that there is a
very convenient \emph{Show Syntax Help} link which can help with the
wiki syntax. You can use this syntax to format your wiki pages.
Consider, for example, the following wiki document:

\begin{verbatim}

== Welcome to Our Wiki! ==

This is our new wiki, which should allow us to collaborate on
documentation. Feel free to add pages showing people how to do stuff.
Below are links to some sections that have already been added.

[[Introduction]]

[[Getting Started]]

[[configuration]]

[[Development]]

[[Support]]

[[Community]]

\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/05-editing-wiki-page.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.24: By clicking \emph{Edit}, you can create/modify
your wiki content.}
\end{figure}

This produces the wiki article you see on the facing page. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-wiki-front-page.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.25: By using the syntax help guide, you can format
your wiki headings and text.}
\end{figure}

This adds a simple heading, a paragraph of text, and several links to
the page. Since the pages behind these links have not been created yet,
clicking one of those links takes you to an editing screen to create the
page. This editing screen looks just like the one you used previously
when you wrote the front page. Liferay displays a notice at the top of
the page stating that the page does not exist yet, and that you are
creating it right now. As you can see, it is very easy to create wiki
pages. All you have to do is create a link from an existing page. Note
that at the top of the screen you can select from the Creole wiki format
and the HTML editor that comes with Liferay. We recommend that you stick
with the Creole format, as it allows for a much cleaner separation of
content and code. If you want all of your users to use the Creole
format, you can disable the HTML format using the
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. See chapter 14 for details about
how to configure this.

At the bottom of the page editing screen, you can select
\emph{Categorization} to add tags. The tags link your wiki to
categories. You can create categories using the Site Administration
page, in the \emph{Content $\rightarrow$Categories} section. Categories are
hierarchical lists of headings under which you can create wiki pages.
This allows you to organize your content in a more formal fashion.

\subsection{Page Details}\label{page-details}

When viewing a page, you can view its details by clicking the
\emph{Details} link which appears in the top right of the page. This
allows you to view many properties of the page. There are several tabs
which organize all of the details into convenient categories.

\subsubsection{Details}\label{details}

The Details tab shows various statistics about the page, and also allows
you to perform some actions on the page.

\textbf{Title:} displays the title of the page.

\textbf{Format:} displays the format for the page -- either Creole,
HTML, or MediaWiki.

\textbf{Latest Version:} displays the latest version of the page. The
wiki portlet automatically keeps track of page versions whenever a page
has been edited.

\textbf{Created By:} displays the user who created the page.

\textbf{Last Changed By:} displays the user who last modified the page.

\textbf{Attachments:} displays the number of attachments to the page.

\textbf{Convert To:} offers different conversion formats for the wiki
page: DOC, ODT, PDF, RTF, SXW, and TXT.

\textbf{RSS Subscription:} displays links which allow you to subscribe
to the page as an RSS feed in three formats: RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, and Atom
1.0.

\textbf{Email Subscription:} contains links allowing you to subscribe to
the entire wiki or just to this page.

\textbf{Advanced Actions:} contains links allowing you to modify the
permissions on the page, make a copy of the page, move (rename) the
page, or move the page to the recycle bin.

\subsubsection{History}\label{history}

This tab shows a list of all of the versions of the wiki page since it
was created. You can revert a page back to a previous state and you can
also compare the differences between versions by selecting the versions
and then clicking the \emph{Compare Versions} button.

\subsubsection{Incoming/Outgoing Links}\label{incomingoutgoing-links}

The next two tabs are for incoming and outgoing links. These are wiki
links to and from the page. You can use this tab to examine how this
page links to other pages and how other pages link back to this page.

\subsubsection{Attachments}\label{attachments}

The last tab is for attachments. You can attach any file to the wiki.
This is mostly used to attach images to wiki articles which can then be
referenced in the text. Referencing them using the proper WikiCreole
syntax renders the image inline, which is a nice way to include
illustrations in your wiki documents.

\subsection{Navigating in the Wiki
Portlet}\label{navigating-in-the-wiki-portlet}

At the top of the portlet is a list of links which allow you to navigate
around the wiki. Simply click on the wiki's name to begin browsing that
wiki. After this is a set of navigation links:

\textbf{Recent Changes:} takes you to a page which shows all of the
recently updated pages.

\textbf{All Pages:} takes you to a flat, alphabetical list of all pages
currently stored in the wiki.

\textbf{Orphan Pages:} takes you to a list of pages that have no links
to them. This can happen if you take a link out of a wiki page in an
edit without realizing it's the only link to a certain page. This area
allows you to review wiki pages that are orphaned in this way so that
you can re-link to them or delete them from the wiki if they are no
longer relevant.

\textbf{Draft Pages:} takes you to a list of pages which have not yet
been published. Users can edit pages and save their changes as drafts.
They can come back later to finish their page changes and publish them
once they have been approved.

\textbf{Search:} allows you to a term here and click the \emph{Search}
button to search for items in the wiki. If the search term is not found,
a link will be displayed which allows you to create a new wiki page on
the topic for which you searched.

The Wiki portlet is another full-featured Liferay application with all
of the features you expect from a state of the art wiki. Next, we'll
look at how Liferay handles live chat.

\section{Find out what others think or do using
Polls}\label{find-out-what-others-think-or-do-using-polls}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/polls-add-new-question.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.26: Besides the Title and the Polls Question, you must
enter data for each of the Choices fields when creating a new poll.}
\end{wrapfigure}

How well do you know your users? Do you ever wonder what they're
thinking? Is using your site easy for them? How do they feel about the
hot-button issues of the day? Do they prefer dogs over cats? What about
the new policy that management wants to implement? What's their favorite
ice cream flavor? When you use Liferay's Polls feature you can find out
the answer to these and other questions that should help you better
understand your users.

There are two portlets involved in making and displaying a poll: the
\emph{Polls} portlet, which is accessed through the Site Administration
page, and the \emph{Polls Display} portlet, which can be added to any
page in the portal.

The Polls portlet helps you set up the poll question and the possible
answers users can select. The Polls Display portlet is an instanceable
portlet that lets you select which poll to display, and is the portlet
you put on the page so users can vote.

The Polls portlet allows users and administrators to create multiple
choice polls that keep track of the votes and display results on the
page. Many separate polls can be managed; a separate portlet called
Polls Display can be configured to display a specific poll's questions
and results.

The Polls Display Portlet allows users to vote for a specific poll's
questions and see the results. Questions must be created from the Polls
portlet on the Site Administration page. You can display one question at
a time or you can combine several questions inside a nested portlet to
create a survey.

We'll begin by creating a poll.

\subsection{Creating a Poll}\label{creating-a-poll}

On your site's Site Administration page, navigate to the \emph{Polls}
link under Content. Click the \emph{Add Question} button. A form appears
that allows you to fill out all the information for your poll.

\textbf{Title:} Enter the name of the poll question.

\textbf{Polls Question:} Enter the text of the poll question.

\textbf{Expiration Date:} Enter the date and time you want the poll to
expire.

\textbf{Choices:} Enter at least two answer options for the poll
question.

\textbf{Add Choice:} Enter additional answer options for the poll
question.

\textbf{Permissions:} Manage who can view and edit the poll.

When you have finished creating your poll, click \emph{Save}, and it is
added to the Polls portlet.

As more polls are created in the Control Panel, they become accessible
through the Polls Display portlet until they are either deleted or they
expire. You can set an expiration date for a poll by selecting the day
and time in the Add Poll form or in the New Question form. The default
is set to \emph{Never Expire}.

When a poll expires, users can't enter votes any more, but if a Polls
Display portlet is still publishing it, the poll results are displayed
on the page. To remove an expired poll from a page, remove the Poll
Display portlet or configure it to show another poll question. See the
section below for more details about the Polls Display portlet.

\emph{Permissions} can be set on individual polls as they are set
elsewhere in Liferay Portal. Permissions can be used, for example, to
allow some privileged users to vote on a certain poll question, while
others can only view it. For further information about permissions,
please see chapters 15 and 16.

As you can see, creating a poll is fairly straightforward. Next, let's
complete the two-step process and put your poll on a page.

\subsection{Adding a Poll to a Page}\label{adding-a-poll-to-a-page}

Now that you have created your poll question, it's time to present it to
your users. Navigate to your site and add the Polls Display portlet to a
page. It is available from the \emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Applications} →
\emph{Content Management} menu.

The Polls Display portlet may look strange when it first appears on your
page. That's because it's not configured. Before visitors to your site
can use the poll, they must be able to access it. Click on the link
labeled *Please configure this portlet to make it visible to all users,
and a dialog box like the one below appears.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../../images/polls-display-config.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.27: In the initial configuration of the Polls Display
portlet, the Question field will remain blank until you select the
appropriate poll question.}
\end{figure}

Under the Setup tab is a menu option labeled \emph{Question}. Selecting
this option displays the name of the poll you created. Choose it, click
\emph{Save}, and it is displayed on the page. That, in a nutshell, is
how you create a poll, but there is another way to add a question to the
Polls Display portlet.

Start by navigating to your site and placing the Polls Display portlet
on a page. Using the icons in the lower left of the portlet, choose the
\emph{Add Question} button. A new form appears that lets you create
another question. When you are done filling out the form, click
\emph{Save} and you new poll appears on the page.

Once the poll question has been successfully placed on the page, you can
perform other tasks by using the icons in the lower left corner of the
portlet. Besides adding questions, you can also edit the currently
selected question or select existing questions.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../../images/polls-config-buttons.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.28: These three buttons, highlighted in red, allow you
to manage the configuration of the poll. Notice this poll has expired.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Edit Question:} Displays a similar dialog box to the one used to
create the poll.

\textbf{Select Question:} Displays the same dialog box as Configuration,
allowing you to choose different questions from the drop-down menu.

\textbf{Add Question:} Allows you to create a new question.

You can also manage the Polls Display portlet by clicking the gear
symbol in the upper right corner of the portlet's title bar. Now let's
see the poll results.

\subsection{Viewing the Poll Results}\label{viewing-the-poll-results}

When you create a poll question, it appears in a list in the
\emph{Content} section of Site Administration. After users vote in the
poll, the data is collected here. If you select it, the name and the
question, as well as a breakdown of the poll results appears, including
percentages and total number of votes per answer and the total number of
votes cast.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/polls-results.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.29: Selecting a poll in the Polls portlet allows you
to see all the information related to the poll results.}
\end{figure}

Below this is an item called \emph{Charts}. This option shows the poll
results represented in various graphs. The graphs are \emph{Area},
\emph{Horizontal Bar}, \emph{Line}, \emph{Pie}, and \emph{Vertical Bar}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../../images/polls-results-vertical-bar.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.30: This is what the vertical bar graph for the Lunar
Resort poll results looks like.}
\end{figure}

There is also a listing of the users who voted in your poll, how they
voted, and a time/date stamp of when their votes were cast. Registered
users are represented by their screen name while Guest users are
represented by a number.

With Liferay Polls you can do many things. You can ask users very
specific questions or you can use Polls to create a little fun for your
community. As with most things in Liferay, you are only limited by your
imagination. Next, let's learn how to use Liferay's Announcements
portlet.

\section{Sending Alerts and Announcements in Your
Portal}\label{sending-alerts-and-announcements-in-your-portal}

Suppose you're running a portal with lots of users. Maybe you have
thousands or tens of thousands of users (or more!). Wouldn't it be nice
to have an easy way to periodically communicate important information to
them? And wouldn't it be even nicer to have easy ways to periodically
send information to specific groups of users? For example, maybe you'd
like to send a reminder about a new policy to all of the site
administrators on your portal. Or maybe you'd like to send a reminder to
all the members of a certain site to submit an answer to this week's
poll question. Liferay provides two portlets that meet this need: the
Alerts portlet and the Announcements portlet.

The Alerts and Announcements portlets let you broadcast important
information to different groups of users. Each alert or announcement can
be created in a specific scope so that you can manage which
announcements are sent to which users. Furthermore, each portal user can
configure how they'd like to receive announcements: click on
\emph{{[}User Name{]}} $\rightarrow$\emph{My Account} from the Dockbar and then on
\emph{Announcements} in the Miscellaneous category. There's a menu for
customizing the delivery options for alerts and announcements. You can
select a different configuration for each type of alert or announcement:
General, News, or Test. Each kind of announcement that's broadcast to a
user is viewable from the Alerts or Announcements portlet, of course.
But alerts and announcements can also be sent via email or SMS (Short
Message Service, i.e., text).

You can also create roles in Liferay to assign to users that should have
access to announcing general announcements. For instance, if you'd like
an employee in your site to have strict control over what is announced,
you can assign them to an Announcements role. To create a simple
Announcement role, you'll need to navigate to the \emph{Control Panel} →
\emph{Roles} $\rightarrow$\emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Regular Role}. Specify the name of
your role as \emph{Announcements}, click \emph{Save}, and then select
the \emph{Define Permissions} tab. For this particular role, you'll need
to grant two permissions:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{Control Panel $\rightarrow$General Permissions $\rightarrow$Add General Announcements}
\item
  \emph{Site Administration $\rightarrow$Applications $\rightarrow$Announcements $\rightarrow$Add Entry}
\end{itemize}

You'll need to click \emph{Save} after selecting each permission. Now
you have a simple Announcements role that can add an entry to the
Announcements portlet and add general announcements to your site! Of
course, you can add additional permissions to give the Announcements
role more access, if you prefer.

Let's look at how to create announcements in the Announcements portlet.
When you view the Announcements portlet as an administrator, you'll see
two tabs: Entries and Manage Entries. Non-administrators only see the
Entries tab which displays a list of announcements. To add a new
announcement, click on \emph{Manage Entries} and then select a
\emph{Distribution Scope}. The distribution scope determines the group
of users to which your announcement is sent. Announcements created in
the General distribution scope are sent to everyone. If the distribution
scope is set a particular site or role, only members of that site or
role receive the announcements.

Once you've selected a distribution scope, you'll see a list of all the
announcements that have already been created in that scope. You can
click the \emph{Actions} button next to an announcement to edit or
delete it. Click \emph{Add} to create a new announcement. In addition to
the Distribution scope, you can provide the following information:

\textbf{Title:} The title of the announcement. When the announcement is
displayed in the portlet, the full title always appears in bold. If a
URL was entered, the title serves as a link to the site specified in the
URL field.

\textbf{URL:} The URL is optional. If entered, it must be a valid URL,
starting with \emph{http://}. For example, an announcement about a news
story could include a link to the news article.

\textbf{Content:} The body of the announcement. You can use the familiar
CK editor to write the body of your announcement. Use the \emph{Source}
button to switch between the editor view and the HTML view.

\textbf{Type:} Can be \emph{General}, \emph{News}, or \emph{Test}. Each
user can specify a different delivery mechanism for each type of
announcement. For example, a user can specify that she'd like to receive
general announcements via email and text, news announcement via email
only, and no special delivery mechanism for test announcements. Each
user can customize their delivery options by navigating to \emph{{[}User
Name{]}} $\rightarrow$\emph{My Account} from the Dockbar and then clicking on
\emph{Announcements} in the Miscellaneous category.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../../images/alerts-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.31: The Alerts portlet provides administrators with an
easy way to communicate important information to appropriate groups of
users.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Priority:} Can be either \emph{Normal} or \emph{Important}.

\textbf{Display Date:} This determines when the announcement will be
sent to users and will appear in the Announcements portlet. By default,
the \emph{Display Immediately} box is flagged. This sets the display
date to be equal to the creation date. Unflag this box if you'd like to
enter a custom display date. For example, administrators can create
announcements that won't be displayed until a specified future date.
This date can be days, weeks, months, or years in the future. Once the
\emph{Display Immediately} box is unflagged, clicking on the Display
Date field opens the date-picker widget.

\textbf{Expiration Date:} This determines when the announcement expires.
Once an announcement expires, it's no longer displayed by the
Announcements portlet to any users. Clicking on the Expiration Date
field opens the date-picker widget.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/announcements-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.32: The Annoucements portlet displays a list of
annoucements to regular users. It also provides administrators with an
interface for managing and adding entries.}
\end{figure}

The Alerts portlet works the same way as the announcements portlet. It's
a different portlet because it's designed to be be used only for
important messages or message that may require users to take some
action. The Alerts portlet only displays alerts and the Announcements
portlet only displays alerts. The Alerts portlet displays alerts with a
bold red box around each alert message to draw attention to the
displayed entries. Site administrators can place the Alerts and
Announcement portlets on different pages if they'd like to separate
important alerts from more mundane announcements.

Next, let's see what you can do with Liferay's Chat feature.

\section{Staying in touch with the
Chat}\label{staying-in-touch-with-the-chat}

Liferay's Chat portlet provides a convenient way of allowing users to
send each other instant messages when they are logged into your web
site. It appears as a bar at the bottom of every page, showing who is
logged on, their statuses, and any chats the logged-in user has open.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-liferay-chat-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.33: Liferay's Chat Portlet offers ways to update your
status and notifications through the \emph{Settings} menu.}
\end{figure}

The Chat portlet is distributed with the Liferay bundles, but is not
included as part of the \texttt{.war} distribution, as it is a separate
plugin. If you installed the Liferay \texttt{.war} manually on your
application server, you can install the Chat portlet by accessing
Liferay Marketplace. You can go to Marketplace by navigating the Control
Panel and clicking \emph{Store} under the \emph{Apps} heading. You can
learn more about Marketplace and how to purchase/download an app in the
\emph{Liferay Marketplace} chapter.

The Chat portlet is very simple to use. To change the settings, click
\emph{Settings} (found near the lower right corner next to \emph{Online
Friends}). Here you can set your status, choose whether or not to show
that you are online, whether or not to play a sound if someone sends you
a message while you have the window or tab in the background, and
whether to enable desktop notifications for new messages. The Chat
portlet displays the number of your friends who are online. Click the
\emph{Online Friends} link and then click on a friend's name to open a
chat window. You can have multiple chats open at a time, and can have
one or more of them minimized.

\subsection{Filtering Available Users}\label{filtering-available-users}

By default, all online portal users appear in the Chat portlet. If you
want to filter who appears in your contact list you can, but the
configuration must be done by someone who has administrative access to
the server. The configuration change must be made at the time the chat
portlet is deployed.

To filter users, create a \texttt{portlet-ext.properties} file to
override some properties of your Chat portlet's
\texttt{portlet.properties} file. You could modify your chat portlet's
\texttt{portlet.properties} file directly, but it's a best practice to
override it instead.

Before you deploy your Chat portlet, extract it to your file system. You
can create the \texttt{portlet-ext.properties} file in the
\texttt{chat-portlet/WEB-INF/src} directory. It gets copied over to your
\texttt{chat-portlet/WEB-INF/classes} directory upon deployment. When
you're finished making changes to your \texttt{portlet-ext.properties}
file, you'll zip the directory structure back into a .war file for
deployment. Note that the Chat portlet must be redeployed for settings
in properties files to take effect.

The property that refines the list of users that show up in the Chat
portlet is \texttt{bud\-dy.list.stra\-te\-gy}. Some common values are listed
here:

\begin{verbatim}
    buddy.list.strategy=all
    buddy.list.strategy=sites
    buddy.list.strategy=social
    buddy.list.strategy=sites,social
\end{verbatim}

The default value is \texttt{all}. To show only other users of the sites
a user belongs to, set \texttt{buddy.list.strategy} to \texttt{sites}.
Setting \texttt{buddy.list.strategy} to \texttt{social} makes only a
user's social connections available in the Chat portlet. Note that you
can also combine values by separating them with a comma. Combined values
behave like a logical AND statement. Thus, \texttt{sites,social} shows
other users of the sites a user belongs to, and the user's social
connections.

You can also further refine the \texttt{sites} setting by using the
property \texttt{bud\-dy.list\-.site.ex\-cludes}. This property allows you to
exclude specific sites in your portal from the
\texttt{bud\-dy.list.stra\-te\-gy=sites} setting. This is especially useful if
you have a default site that all portal users belong to, but you still
want to filter the users that appear in the Chat portlet by site. If
this default site isn't excluded, then all portal users show up in the
chat portlet when \texttt{buddy.list.strategy} is set to \texttt{sites}.
The site name to give for \texttt{buddy.list.site.excludes} is the value
of the \texttt{name} column for the \texttt{Group} table in your
portal's database. It must be entered in the same case as it is in the
database. For example, if you want to exclude a site called Default,
enter \texttt{bud\-dy.list.site.ex\-cludes=Default}. That site is then
ignored when determining the users to show in the Chat portlet.

The \texttt{social} setting for \texttt{bud\-dy.list.stra\-te\-gy} has further
filtering options as well. You can set the allowed types of social
relationships through the property
\texttt{bud\-dy.list\-.al\-lowed.so\-cial.rel\-a\-tion.types}. By default this
property is set to \texttt{2,12}. Those values correspond, respectively,
to the \emph{Friend} and \emph{Connection} social relationship types.
The values for some additional social relationship types are listed here
along with those of \emph{Friend} and \emph{Connection}:

\begin{verbatim}
    TYPE_BI_CONNECTION = 12
    TYPE_BI_COWORKER = 1
    TYPE_BI_FRIEND = 2
    TYPE_BI_ROMANTIC_PARTNER = 3
    TYPE_BI_SIBLING = 4
\end{verbatim}

These are bidirectional social relationship types as defined in
Liferay's social API. It's important to note that these aren't available
out-of-the-box. You must install apps that make use of them before you
can leverage them in your portal. For example, Liferay's Social
Networking app from the
\href{http://www.liferay.com/marketplace}{Marketplace} makes use of the
``Friend'' social relationship type. Similarly, Liferay Social Office
uses the ``Connection'' social relationship type. Developers can make
use of any of the social relationship types available in the API.

\subsection{Jabber Server Integration}\label{jabber-server-integration}

Liferay 6.1 introduced Jabber server integration to Liferay's Chat
portlet. Jabber is the original name of the XMPP (Extensible Messaging
and Presence Protocol) protocol, an open-standard communications
protocol based on XML. Using a chat server helps Liferay's chat scale to
very large installations and allows for communication between different
chat clients. For example, Jabber server integration allows users using
the chat portlet in their browser windows to chat with other users using
desktop clients like Empathy, Pidgin, or Kopete.

Jabber server integration is not enabled by default since it requires a
running Jabber server. Once you have installed and started a Jabber
server, you can enable Jabber server integration by creating a
\texttt{portlet-ext.properties} file to override some properties of your
Chat portlet's \texttt{portlet.properties} file. You could modify your
Chat portlet's \texttt{portlet.properties} file directly, but it's a
best practice to override it instead.

\subsubsection{Installation Steps}\label{installation-steps}

You can use any chat server that supports Jabber. The Chat portlet's
Jabber server integration feature was tested with versions 3.7.0 and
3.7.1 of Openfire, a real time collaboration server distributed under
the Open Source Apache License. You can download Openfire from
\url{http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/}. To enable Jabber
chat integration, follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Start your chat server. If you are using Openfire on a Linux/Mac
  system, you can start/stop the chat server by executing the openfire
  shell script in the \texttt{openfire/bin} directory. Usage:
  \texttt{./openfire start} or \texttt{./openfire stop}
\item
  Override the \texttt{portlet.properties} file in your
  /chat-portlet/WEB-INF/src/ directory with a
  \texttt{portlet-ext.properties} file in the same directory. When you
  deploy the portlet, the properties files should be copied to your
  /chat-portlet/WEB-INF/classes/ directory. If you have already deployed
  the Chat portlet, create the \texttt{portlet-ext.properties} file in
  your /chat-portlet/WEB-INF/classes/ directory. The contents of your
  \texttt{portlet-ext.properties} file should like this:

\begin{verbatim}
jabber.enabled=true
jabber.import.user.enabled=true
jabber.host=localhost
jabber.port=5222
jabber.service.name=<Host Name>
jabber.resource=Liferay
jabber.sock5.proxy.enabled=false
jabber.sock5.proxy.port=-1
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

Note that you must change \texttt{jabber.service.name} to the ``Host
Name''. If you are using Openfire, you can find the Host Name by using
the Openfire administration web tool. If you did not set up
administrative credentials when you started Openfire, the default
credentials are username: admin, password: admin.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/jabber-service-name.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.34: View your server information using the Openfire
Administration Web Tool.}
\end{figure}

Additionally, make sure that you set \texttt{jabber.enabled} to
\texttt{true} and have added the correct values to \texttt{jabber.host}
and \texttt{jab\-ber.port}. If you installed your chat server on a remote
machine or chose to not use the default port, change
\texttt{jabber.host} and \texttt{jab\-ber.port} accordingly.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Deploy your Chat portlet. Remember that this portlet must be of
  version 6.1 or higher.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Single Sign On}\label{single-sign-on}

If the property \texttt{jab\-ber.im\-port.us\-er.en\-a\-bled} is set to
\texttt{true}, the Chat portlet will import the user automatically to
Jabber after he logs in to the portal. Once the user is imported, he can
use any Jabber client using the same screen name and password he uses to
log in to the portal. His buddies will be also imported as they become
online in the Chat portlet.

Note that it's a ``lazy import''. Users are imported only after they log
in to the portal and their buddies will be added to his list only if
they see each other within the Chat portlet. They won't be able to use
other Jabber chat clients until they log in to the portal.

If \texttt{jabber.import.user.enabled} is set to \texttt{false}, users
need to create their Jabber account and add buddies manually. They have
to create their accounts using the same screen name and password they
use in the portal. If they don't, the Chat portlet won't be able to
connect to their Jabber account.

Alternatively, since Openfire integrates with LDAP, if you are using
Openfire and your portal is also using LDAP for authentication, you can
disable the \texttt{jab\-ber.im\-port.us\-er.en\-a\-bled} property.

Next, let's look at how you can integrate your email addresses with
Liferay's Mail portlet.

\section{Integrating your email with Liferay
Mail}\label{integrating-your-email-with-liferay-mail}

Liferay's Mail portlet enables your users to interact with their email
using an easy to use, ubiquitous web interface. If your mail system
supports the IMAP protocol, you can use the Mail portlet to integrate
your users' mail with the rest of your web site. You can also connect
the Mail portlet to a mail account provided by Google.

The Mail portlet is distributed with the Liferay bundles, but is not
included as part of the \texttt{.war} distribution, as it is a separate
plugin. If you installed the Liferay \texttt{.war} manually on your
application server, you can install the Mail portlet by accessing
Liferay Marketplace. You can go to Marketplace by navigating the the
Control Panel and clicking \emph{Store} under the \emph{Apps} heading.
You can learn more about Marketplace and how to purchase/download an app
in the \emph{Liferay Marketplace} chapter.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-mail-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 9.35: Read, reply, and create messages using Liferay's
Mail Portlet.}
\end{figure}

To connect the Mail portlet with an email account, click the \emph{Add
Mail Account} link. From there, you are given a choice between a Custom
email Account or a Gmail Account. Choose the option that you wish, and
fill out the form that appears.

For a Gmail account, all you need to do is provide your email address
and your password, and the portlet will take care of the rest.

For a Custom Mail Account, the following fields are necessary:

\textbf{Address}: lets you enter the email address which receives mail
for this account.

\textbf{Login}: lets you choose a user name for logging into the
account.

\textbf{Password}: lets you choose a password for logging into the
account.

\textbf{Save Password}: allows Liferay to save your password so you
won't have to enter it next time you access your mail account.

\textbf{Incoming Host Name}: allows you to specify the host name for
your IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol) or POP server.

\textbf{Incoming Port}: allows you to specify the port upon which the
IMAP or POP service is running.

\textbf{Use Secure Incoming Connection}: allows you to use an encrypted
connection to the server provided that your server supports it.

\textbf{Outgoing SMTP Server}: lets you enter the host name of your SMTP
(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server.

\textbf{Outgoing Port}: allows you to specify the port upon which the
SMTP service is running.

\textbf{Use Secure Outgoing Connection}: allows you to use an encrypted
connection to the server provided that your server supports it.

When finished, click \emph{Save}. Your new email account now appears as
a tab at the top of the page along with the button for adding a mail
account. In this way, you can add as many mail accounts as you want in
order to view them in the portlet.

Click the tab for the mail account you just configured to be brought to
an interface which allows you to read your mail and compose new
messages. To read a message, click on it. To compose a new message,
click the \emph{Compose} link on the left side of the portlet. A form
appears which allows you to compose an email message using the same rich
text editor that appears everywhere else in Liferay. You can read,
reply, and create messages, as well as manage all of your folders in
Liferay's Mail portlet.

The Mail portlet is a great way to integrate a familiar service with
other the collaboration features that Liferay provides.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-9}

We have explored many of the portlets in Liferay's collaboration suite.
The Blogs and Blogs Aggregation portlets can be used to manage shared
blogs or blogs belonging to a group of people at once. These portlets
have all the features you would want in a blog, including rich text
editing, links to news aggregators, tags, RSS feeds, and more.

The Calendar portlet, likewise, can be used to manage a shared calendar
or a group calendar. It includes features for events, event
notification, repeatable events, and import and export to and from the
standard iCalendar format.

Discussion becomes easy with Liferay's Message Boards portlet. This
portlet can be used to manage heavily trafficked discussion forums with
ease. It inherits all of the security features of the Liferay platform
and includes administrative functions for thread priorities, moving
threads, nested discussion categories, banning users, and more.

Liferay's Wiki portlet is a state of the art wiki application that users
can make use of to collaborate on web pages. Again, it inherits the
strengths of the Liferay platform in the form of security, interface,
and search. You can use the wiki portlet to manage several wiki nodes or
use many wiki portlets to manage one node each.

The Polls portlet is a fun way to interact with users of your site to
get an understanding of what they're thinking at any given time. It
allows you to create multiple choice polls that keep track of the votes
and display results on the page. You can view these results in a number
of ways, including charts.

The Announcements portlet allows administrators to create and manage
announcements and allows users to view the announcements. The
announcements can be sent via email or text or they can simply be
displayed on the portal. The Announcements portlet provides a good way
for administrators to communicate to different groups of users since
each announcement can be scoped to a specific site or role.

Liferay provides a chat solution for your portal that's very easy to
use. It allows logged-in users to see who else is logged in to the
portal and view their status. Users can go invisible if they don't want
others to know that they're online. Users can chat with each other via
instant messages. You can also set up a Jabber chat server and configure
Liferay to use it; this allows users who have logged in to your portal
via their browsers to chat with users using traditional desktop clients.

Integrating mail with your portal is easy with the Mail portlet. You can
add as many custom or Gmail mail accounts as you wish, and this portlet
can keep them all organized in one place, together with the rest of the
things Liferay is aggregating for you.

Liferay's collaboration platform is a full suite of integrated
applications that empower users to work together. You can use them to
great effect to enhance your portal and to build a vibrant, active
community.

\chapter{Social Networking}\label{social-networking}

Since the first social networks rose to popularity, concepts such as
\emph{Friend} and later \emph{Like}--previously reserved for direct
human interaction--have taken on new meaning in an always-online,
information driven culture. It could be argued that social networks have
transformed the way people interact with their friends, relatives and
colleagues. Friends, connections, followers, circles and lists have
enabled people to connect and stay connected in ways they'd never been
able to before. Initially, these concepts proved to be highly successful
for casual web sites but they didn't take to the business world as
quickly. But many organizations are now realizing the importance of
leveraging social interactions for more than just recreation. Liferay's
robust social features make it a great platform for business web sites,
casual web sites and everything in between.

Social applications have many differences when compared to Standard
applications that are vital to a social networking site. Standard
applications have general and user specific data, whereas social
applications can share data within a defined network. This variation is
a huge advantage when trying to communicate important information to a
large group of people. This difference in communication settings is
illustrated below:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/15-opensocial-5.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.1: The graphic above demonstrates Standard Apps
vs.~Social Apps.}
\end{figure}

Liferay has a constantly improving set of social features which enable
you to encourage social interactions on your own portal and to leverage
the power and popularity of other social networks. In this chapter,
we'll discuss:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  General use social portlets
\item
  Social portlets for personal pages
\item
  Configuring personal pages for social networking
\item
  How to connect users using Liferay social relations
\item
  Social equity
\item
  Integrating Liferay with other social sites
\end{itemize}

When we're finished, you'll be well equipped to use Liferay to power
your social network.

\section{Leveraging Social Portlets, Activities Tracking, and User
Connections}\label{leveraging-social-portlets-activities-tracking-and-user-connections}

Liferay has many portlets available for social interaction and
collaboration. Some of these portlets are designed to help you work
together as a team, while others are designed to foster social
interactions between team members at your organization.

Some of the social networking portlets should be used on the public
pages of your portal, while others should be used as part of a user's
personal site. As you might expect, the portlets intended for personal
page use are more focused on simple social interactions while the ones
which can be placed on any site help teams interact and improve
productivity.

Unless otherwise noted, these portlets are provided with minimal
configuration options. Most of them have at least two configuration
options--the option to change permissions for the portlet view and
sharing options for connecting the portlet to other web sites. Some of
the social networking portlets provide additional options for
customizing feed lengths or display styles. Additional styling changes
can be made through custom CSS.

\subsection{Using the Core Liferay Social
Portlets}\label{using-the-core-liferay-social-portlets}

Out-of-the box, Liferay provides four social portlets:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Activities
\item
  User Statistics
\item
  Group Statistics
\item
  Requests
\end{itemize}

The Activities portlet displays information about user activity in the
site to which the portlet was added. User activities tracked by the
Activities portlet include updates to the Documents and Media library,
blog posts, message boards posts, wiki pages, and bookmarks. The
Activities portlet also tracks information about web content but only
displays this information if the logged-in user is a site administrator.
The Activities portlet functions similarly to Facebook's news feed: it
provides a summary of recent site activity. The Activities portlet could
be used on a site's public or private pages to show what site members
have been up to or it could be used on the public or private pages of a
user's personal site. When added to a personal site, the Activities
portlet just shows the activities of a single user.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/activities-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.2: The Activities portlet displays information about
asset-related user activity in the current site. It only displays
information about web content if the current user is a site
administrator.}
\end{figure}

Note that the Activities portlet provides links to the assets described
in its activities feed. However, the links to the assets won't work
unless there's a way to display the assets on the page. For example,
suppose that the user Joe Bloggs uploaded a document called \emph{Lunar
Resort happenings for August} to a site. If the Activities portlet has
been placed on a page of that site, it will display a feed entry with a
link to the \emph{Lunar Resort happenings for August} document. However,
the link won't work unless there's a Documents and Media portlet or a
Documents and Media Display portlet for the document to be displayed in.
Remember add the appropriate portlets to the page of the Activities
portlet if you want the Activities portlet's links to work.

The User Statistics and Group Statistics portlets integrate with
Liferay's social activity system which tracks user activity and assigns
points for various actions. They're useful for displaying various kinds
of statistical information such as the most active users, the average
number of activities per day and the highest periods of activity. The
exact information that's displayed is configurable and you can add
counters to track many different kinds of information such as the number
of comments on users' assets, number of subscriptions to users' assets,
number of blog entries by the user, number of blog entry updates by the
user, number of message board posts, etc. Although these are core
Liferay portlets, they're only useful if Liferay's social activity
system has been enabled for your site. We'll discuss the User Statistics
and Group Statistics in more detail once after we've discussed Liferay's
social activity system.

Lastly, the Requests portlet can be added to pages of users' personal
sites to allow users to respond to social requests such as friend
requests. The Requests portlet is usually added to the private page set
of a personal site since only one user, the owner of the personal site,
is allowed to use it. The Requests portlet is a core Liferay portlet but
is only useful if there's some way to send social requests, such as
friend requests. This functionality can be added by installing the
Social Networking app from Liferay Marketplace. It's also possible to
develop and deploy custom portlets that implement Liferay's social API
to enable social requests. Please refer to the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop}{Liferay
Developer Network} or the
\href{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portlet/social/service/package-summary.html}{Javadocs}
for information about Liferay's social API.

\subsection{Installing the Social Networking
Portlets}\label{installing-the-social-networking-portlets}

Social Activity can be enabled on a per-site basis in Liferay Portal.
The Activities, User Statistics, and Group Statistics portlet can be
used out-of-the box. Liferay provides additional social networking
functionality in the form of the Social Networking app that's available
from \href{http://www.liferay.com/marketplace}{Liferay Marketplace}. The
Social Networking app provides a number of social portlets that allow
you do anything from building an intranet to improve your team's ability
to collaborate to building a public social networking site to rival
Facebook or Linked-In!

The Social Networking app provides the following portlets:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Friends
\item
  Friends' Activities
\item
  Wall
\item
  Map
\item
  Members
\item
  Members' Activities
\item
  Meetups
\item
  Summary
\end{itemize}

If these social networking portlets aren't enough to satisfy your needs,
make sure to check out Liferay Social Office which is also available as
an app on Liferay Marketplace. Social Office provides additional
portlets and functionality including contacts, microblogs, events,
tasks, private messaging, site templates, and a custom theme.

You can manage the plugins in your portal from the Control Panel. If
you're logged in as an administrator, go to the Control Panel and click
on \emph{App Manager} in the \emph{Apps} section. From here, you can
administer all your plugins. For now, we'll deal with the \emph{Social
Networking} app. Under the Apps heading, click \emph{Store} to navigate
to Liferay Marketplace. Install and download the \emph{Social
Networking} portlet to your portal instance.

Now that we have our social plugins ready to go, let's learn how to use
them!

\subsection{Using Social Networking on Public
Pages}\label{using-social-networking-on-public-pages}

There are several social portlets that are designed for use on public
portal pages. The goal of these is to use social connections to help a
group work together more closely. These include the \textbf{Members},
\textbf{Meetups}, \textbf{Summary}, and \textbf{Activities} portlets.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{../../images/XX-social-networking-members-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.3: The \emph{Members} portlet displays all the
members of a particular site.}
\end{figure}

The Members portlet is a simple list of all the current site's members.
The only configuration options you have are permissions, which are the
same for every portlet. For example, you might change the permissions so
only members of the current site can view the portlet.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/XX-social-networking-meetups.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.4: Meetups are organized in the two tabs \emph{All
Meetups} and \emph{My Meetups}.}
\end{figure}

The Meetups portlet is a tool for creating casual meetings for users of
your portal. Anyone can create a ``meetup'' and give it a title,
description, date/time, maximum number of attendees, price and provide
an image. Any meetups that are created are displayed in the portlet for
anyone to view. Users can register for the meetup, which lets the
organizer keep track of who's coming.

The options for creating a meetup are essentially the same as those for
creating a calendar event and the Meetups portlet shares some
functionality with the Calendar. For more information on the Calendar
portlet and configuring events, see chapter 8.

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/XX-social-networking-activities.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.5: All of your site members' activities are listed
with brief descriptions and time stamps.}
\end{wrapfigure}

The Activities portlet comes in two varieties: the standard Activities
portlet and the Members' Activities portlet. The basic function of the
portlets are the same--they both display a feed of what users are doing
on the portal. The difference is that Activities displays what's going
on across the entire portal, while Members' Activities displays only
what members of the current site have been doing. There's also a
Friend's Actvities portlet that's intended for use on users' personal
pages. In the Configuration dialog box of any variety of the Activities
portlet, you can use the \emph{Maximum Activities to Display} dropdown
menu to set a limit on how many activities can be displayed at once in
the portlet window.

The Map portlet allows you to view the locations of site members, both
locally and internationally. Only members of the site to which the Map
portlet has been added are displayed. In order to configure the Map
portlet, you need to install the IP Geocoder portlet (available from
Liferay Marketplace) and configure it to access MaxMind GeoIP or GeoLite
on your server. For more information on configuring geolocation
services, visit the MaxMind support page at
\url{http://www.maxmind.com/app/installation?city=1}. Once you've
installed the Geocoder portlet and configured it to access MaxMind GeoIP
or GeoLite, you'll need a key from Google to access Google's Maps API so
your Map portlet will work. Visit
\url{https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial\#api_key}
to learn how to obtain a valid Google API key. To configure the Map
portlet using the GeoLite City database, use the following steps:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/map-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.6: The Map portlet can be placed on a single user's
page to display one location or on the main site page to display all
users' location.}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Install the Social Networking plugin, if you haven't already done so.
\item
  Install the IP Geocoder portlet. (Both the Social Networking and IP
  Geocoder apps can be installed from Martketplace.)
\item
  Shut down your application server.
\item
  Download the Geo Lite City database from
  \url{http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz}.
\item
  Unzip the \texttt{.dat} file to your desired storage location.
\item
  Create a \texttt{port\-let-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file in the
  \texttt{/[ROOT]/web\-apps/ip-geo\-coder\--port\-let/WEB-INF/clas\-ses/}
  directory of your Liferay installation.
\item
  Add the property
  \texttt{maxmind.database.file=[database file]} to this
  file.

  Note: Make sure your the file's directory path is separated by
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}}. For example:
  \texttt{E:\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}ce\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}bundles\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}GeoLiteCity.dat}.
\item
  Create a \texttt{portlet-ext.properties} file in the
  \texttt{/[ROOT]/web\-apps/soc\-ial-net\-work\-ing-port\-let/WEB-INF/clas\-ses/}
  directory of your Liferay installation.
\item
  Add the property \texttt{map.google.maps.api.key=\{Your API Key\}} to
  this file. If you haven't done so already, you'll need to generate a
  Google Maps API Key.\footnote{\url{https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial\#api_key}}
\item
  Restart your application server.
\item
  Enjoy the Maps portlet!
\end{enumerate}

Next, let's look at the social networking portlets designed for use on
personal pages.

\subsection{Using Social Networking on Personal
Pages}\label{using-social-networking-on-personal-pages}

In addition to the portlets available for general use, there are a
handful that can only be used on personal pages. These include the
Summary, Wall, Friends, and Friends' Activities portlets. These portlets
can be used to create profile pages similar to Facebook's or Google+'s.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/XX-social-networking-personal-portlets.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.7: You can get creative with Social Networking
portlets and make a custom designed profile page.}
\end{figure}

The Summary portlet provides a quick overview of a user's profile. When
posted in a user's personal site, it displays the user's name, profile
picture and job title. Users can add additional personal information by
clicking on \emph{Edit} in the portlet and filling in information in the
\emph{About Me} section. This portlet is essential to any social
implementation on Liferay, because it has the \emph{Friend Request}
button. This enables users to initiate social relationships. Note that
this portlet simplifies a much more powerful underlying social
networking API that defines many different kinds of relationships,
including friends. Your developers can take advantage of this API to
create powerful social applications. For more information on this, see
\emph{Liferay in Action} (Manning
Publications)\footnote{\url{http://manning.com/sezov}} or the Liferay Developer's Network.\footnote{\url{https://dev.liferay.com}}

The Wall portlet provides a place for users to leave messages on other
users' profiles. The messages can only be plain text as no formatting or
HTML is supported. Once a post is added to their wall, users have the
ability delete it or respond to it with a quick link to post on the
original poster's wall.

The Friends portlet shows a list of all the user's friends with links to
their profiles. The Friends' Activities portlet displays information
about a user's friends' activities on the portal.

Now that we've discussed the functions of the suite of social networking
portlets that ships with Liferay, let's put them all together and make a
social web site.

\subsection{Liferay's Social Tools in
Action}\label{liferays-social-tools-in-action}

To get started with Liferay's social features, let's set up the public
pages of our users' personal sites to include social apps. Because of
Liferay's flexible page layout options, we have a large number of
options for how to set the pages up. For simplicity's sake, we'll make
something that's fairly similar to the original Facebook layout.

\subsubsection{Setting up Users' Personal
Pages}\label{setting-up-users-personal-pages}

Before we start adding portlets to pages, we should configure Liferay so
that everyone (or some subset of everyone) has the same social features.
We have two ways to do this with advantages and disadvantages to each.

\textbf{User Groups:} Placing users into a group enables you to create a
user group site for them. The pages and portlets defined by the user
group site are copied to members' personal sites. With the user group
site, you can control whether users can modify pages and you can push
changes out to users in the future. Once the site template is assigned
to a user group, you can set the \emph{Default User Associations} to
have all users be the member of a particular group in \emph{Portal
Settings} in the Control Panel. The advantage of this is that it can be
managed entirely through the GUI and it's easy to configure. If you base
your user group's site on a template, you can use the \emph{Enable
propagation of changes from the site template} option to manage all user
pages simply by changing the template. This is the recommended way to
manage personal pages across the portal. For more information on user
group sites, see chapter 15.

\textbf{Portal Properties Configuration:} The legacy way to do this is
with the configuration file. You can specify a default layout and
portlets for personal pages in your \texttt{por\-tal-ext\-.pro\-per\-ties} file.
Note that this method applies changes to all users' personal sites.
However, it does not provide as much maintainability or as many
customization options as does using user group sites. User group sites
allow you to choose what's modifiable by the user. For more information
on the \texttt{portal-ext.properties} method, see \emph{Default User
Private Layouts} and \emph{Default User Public Layouts} in chapter 20.

Because it's the recommended method, we'll use the user group method to
create the layouts. As an administrator, go to the Control Panel and
select \emph{Site Templates} from under the \emph{Sites} section. Click
\emph{Add} and fill out the form. We'll call our new site template
\emph{Social Layout}. Click \emph{Save}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/social-networking-site-template.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.8: You can give your site template a custom name and
description and also specify several configuration settings..}
\end{figure}

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Tip: Unchecking \emph{Allow Site Administrators to Modify the Pages
Associated with this Site Template} only prevents users from modifying
the specific pages contained in the template but does not disable a
user's ability to add or modify additional pages.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}
Once you've created the template, choose \emph{Actions $\rightarrow$View Pages}.
Let's change the name of the page from the default to \emph{My Profile}
and add some portlets to the page. Back in the Control Panel, select
\emph{User Groups} from the \emph{Users} section. Once there, click
\emph{Add} and name the group \emph{Social Users}. When creating a user
group, you have the option to set a user group site; use this option and
select the Social Layout template for your Public Pages.

Now go to \emph{Portal Settings} and select \emph{Users} from the
submenu. From the Users page, go to the \emph{Default User Associations}
tab and enter \emph{Social Users} in the User Groups section. Now all
users on the portal get a Social Profile page. Now the question is, how
do we encourage users to visit each others fancy new profile pages?

\subsubsection{Connecting Users Through
Collaboration}\label{connecting-users-through-collaboration}

There are many ways that social networks connect users. These generally
involve some kind of mutual interest or experience. On a site like
Facebook, you can connect with people from school, from work or from
other personal connections. On a music based networking site like
Last.fm, you can connect with people who have similar tastes to yours.
With Liferay's social networking collaboration is the key to connection.

Using our example site of lunar-resort.com, we can take a closer look at
ways users can be connected through hierarchies and ways they can
connect to each other. We'll look at a handful of portlets, both those
designed specifically for connecting users and those that can create
connections as a side-effect of just getting work done.

The Site Members Directory portlet can provide a simple way for users to
connect. If we have a site dedicated to Lunar Resort astronauts, we can
place a Site Members Directory portlet on that site, listing all the
users that have joined that site. Users can connect by sending requests
to other users on that list. This isn't the worst way to get users
connected but it probably won't be very effective. Why not? Well, other
than sharing some very basic common interests, we haven't really had any
interactions.

The Activities portlet provides a similar but more effective means of
connection. Because it shows a list of what other users are doing, this
portlet helps users discover who is among the most active across the
site or the portal, and thus who might be a good connection.

Probably the most effective way users can connect is by interacting with
other users. Every portlet in the Collaboration category provides
information on who is contributing, regardless of how. You can see who
is creating a thread in a message board, editing a wiki article,
blogging or creating a calendar event. Users can use these to connect
based on content--if I find your blog interesting, or if you answer my
question on the message board, we can use that as a point to connect as
friends to further our interactions. This way, instead of our connection
being forced or arbitrary, we've connected based on the fact that we've
directly interacted and share a common interest--just like people did
before they had the internet.

``Friend'' is only the default social relationship as implemented by
Liferay's social portlets. You can design things so that users are
automatically connected through Site and Organization membership. And
there are many other relationship types beyond Friend: your developers
can take advantage of these by using Liferay's social API. This is
covered in \emph{\href{http://www.manning.com/sezov}{Liferay in Action}}
and the \emph{Liferay Developer Network}. Now that you've got all these
social applications running on your system, you might wonder: how can I
measure social interaction? How do I identify the best contributors to
my site? Liferay has an answer: social activity measurements.

\section{Measuring Social Activity}\label{measuring-social-activity}

When you have a lot of user interaction on your web site, it can be
helpful to try to separate the signal from the noise. Liferay contains a
lot of applications which end users can use to communicate with each
other and provide information. Some of this information is good and
helpful and some of it can be rather unhelpful. Using Liferay's Social
Activity feature will help show which users are making real, valuable
contributions.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-social-equity.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.9: The Social Activity page of the Control Panel
allows you to enable social activity for assets and specify points for
participation and contributions.}
\end{figure}

To activate Social Activity, you'll first need to determine which
collaboration applications you want to use Social Activity. There are
currently three types of content you can use with Social Activity -
Blogs Entries, Message Board Messages, and Wiki Pages. Activation is a
la carte - so you can use it on one, two, or all three applications.
Social Activity tracks three metrics from within each of these
applications two are for the user - \emph{Participation} and
\emph{Contribution} - and the other, \emph{Popularity}, is for the asset
involved.

Let's activate Social Activity for Blogs Entries. Check the box next to
\emph{Blog Entry}. You now have options to set point values and limits
on several different actions for blogs. You'll notice each item on the
list has dropdowns you can use to set the number of participation and
contribution points; popularity points are tied directly to contribution
points. In addition to that, you can expand the box by clicking
\emph{Limits} in the top right of each list item. You can use this to
set a limit on how many times a user can perform this activity with a
specific asset and receive the requisite points. For some activities,
you can set limits on both participation and contribution points, but on
new content creation, you can only set limits on participation points.

It might not be immediately obvious, but for all actions that do not
involve the creation of a new asset, all of the contribution points go
to the original asset creator and all popularity points go to the
original asset. That means if \emph{Votes on a Blog} is set to have 1
\emph{Participation} point and 5 \emph{Contribution} points (and
therefore 5 \emph{Popularity} points), the user who votes on the asset
will receive 1 participation point, the user who created the asset will
receive 5 contribution points, and the asset will receive 5 popularity
points.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/social-equity-limits.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.10: You can set limits for your site's social
activity.}
\end{figure}

It's easy to assign points--you can arbitrarily assign points for just
about anything--the challenge is making the points significant in some
way. As mentioned before, the primary purpose of social activity
tracking is to make sure that users who regularly contribute to the
portal and participate in discussions are recognized as such. So the
central piece of the social equity display is the \emph{User Statistics}
portlet.

The User Statistics portlet displays a list of users ranked by an
amalgamation of their participation and contribution scores. By clicking
on the Configuration icon for the portlet, you can change some of the
specifics of the rankings. There are five check boxes that you can
enable or disable:

\textbf{Rank by Contribution}: If this is checked, a user's contribution
score will be used as a factor in calculating their rank.

\textbf{Rank by Participation}: If this is checked, a user's
participation score will be used as a factor in calculating their rank.

\textbf{Show Header Text}: Determines whether the title shows or only
the rankings.

\textbf{Show Totals}: Toggles the display of the users activity score
next to their name.

\textbf{Display Additional Activity Counters}: You can toggle the
display of any number of other pieces of information next to the users
name in the statistics, ranging from the number of comments on assets a
user has created to the number of wiki articles that the user has
created. If you want to display multiple data points, you can click the
\emph{plus} button to add one and the \emph{minus} button to remove one.
You can have as many data points displayed as you want, but displaying
too many might make your portlet a little unwieldy.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/user-statistics-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.11: The User Statistics portlet gives rankings to
promote user contributions and participation.}
\end{figure}

The \emph{Group Statistics} portlet provides some more advanced data
analytics. If you add it to a page, and click on the configuration icon,
you can select the assets to track. You can click the \emph{plus} button
to add additional slots, and choose from the various metrics available
for each slot, covering virtually any action that a user can perform on
content in the portal. If you decide that you're displaying too many
metrics, you can click the \emph{minus} button for a particular slot on
the configuration view to remove it.

There are a wide-ranging number of actions that you can provide social
credit for. Users can receive credit for everything from subscribing to
a blog to writing wiki articles. You can easily tweak the numbers in the
Control Panel if it becomes clear that certain activities are weighted
too high or too low.

Social Activity can be an invaluable tool for portals that are heavily
driven by community-created content. It allows you to easily recognize
users who are major contributors and it indicates to new users whose
advice will be most trustworthy. Social Activity is easy to set up and
can be configured differently for each site, increasing the flexibility
of your portal.

Beyond Liferay's social API, there is also support for the OpenSocial
standard.

\section{Exporting Portal Apps as Widgets and OpenSocial
Gadgets}\label{exporting-portal-applications-as-widgets-and-opensocial-gadgets}

OpenSocial is a framework designed for the creation of socially themed
application programming interfaces (APIs). OpenSocial applications,
called \emph{gadgets}, can be used in any web-based application that
supports them. They are characterized as simple, widely available, and
easy to deploy. Gadgets are especially popular on social networking
sites. They can, however, be used in many different ways throughout your
site.

Liferay allows any OpenSocial gadget to be used on a page. An OpenSocial
gadget is specified in an XML document and consists of embedded HTML and
JavaScript. Liferay allows gadgets to communicate with each other and
with portlets. This allows your gadgets to run seamlessly without your
having to constantly check or update their content. They automatically
update based on their connections with other applications. OpenSocial
gadgets support numerous open web technologies such as \emph{OAuth},
which we'll discuss in more detail later in the chapter.

Gadgets are socially aware and can share data across a community of
users. You can define your own groups and create gadgets to communicate
information based on pages (community/team pages), applications
(gadgets/widgets/portlets), data, users, roles and authorization, and
policies. In short, you can develop gadgets to allow individuals to
access and share data within their social networks.

\subsection{Adding OpenSocial Gadgets}\label{adding-opensocial-gadgets}

The OpenSocial plugin can be installed through Liferay Marketplace for
both Liferay CE and EE. Installing the OpenSocial plugin enables you to
add OpenSocial gadgets to pages, just like you'd add portlets. There are
two types of gadgets:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  ``Adhoc'' gadgets that users can add to a page via URL
\item
  Gadgets published by the Control Panel that are available portal-wide
\end{itemize}

First, we'll go through steps to add an Adhoc gadget to a page.

\subsubsection{Adding Adhoc Gadgets}\label{adding-adhoc-gadgets}

This method is a quick way to add a gadget to a single page. To do this,
go to the \emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{More} menu and add \emph{OpenSocial Gadget}
to the page. The portlet displays a link to pick a gadget for display:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/15-opensocial-1.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.12: Configure a gadget to display in your portlet.}
\end{figure}

Click the configure link and a configuration window opens. Next, you
need to insert a URL to an OpenSocial gadget. We'll insert the URL for a
colorful calculator which is:

\begin{verbatim}
http://www.labpixies.com/campaigns/calc/calc.xml
\end{verbatim}

After pasting the URL into the text field, click \emph{Save} and your
new gadget is visible on your page.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/15-opensocial-2.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.13: The calculator gadget displays seemlessly on your
page.}
\end{figure}

This particular gadget allows you to change its ``skins'' to fit your
needs. Likewise, there are many other user-friendly interactive gadgets
that give you flexibility to fit them into your themed sites. As you
find gadgets that would work nicely throughout your portal, you can
publish them for portal-wide use. You'll learn that next.

\subsubsection{Adding Gadgets for Portal-wide
Use}\label{adding-gadgets-for-portal-wide-use}

You can easily make gadgets available for adding to pages as you would
any other application. We'll demonstrate this by adding a \emph{To-Do
List} gadget for portal-wide use.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Go to the Control Panel and select \emph{OpenSocial Gadget Publisher}
  under the \emph{Apps} heading
\item
  Click \emph{Publish Gadget}
\item
  Insert the URL for the \emph{To-Do List} gadget.\footnote{\url{http://www.labpixies.com/campaigns/todo/todo.xml}}
\item
  Select an appropriate category for your gadget
\item
  Click \emph{Save}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/15-opensocial-38.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.14: Configure new gadgets with ease.}
\end{figure}

Your \emph{OpenSocial Gadget Publisher} should now look like this:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/15-opensocial-3.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.15: Publish gadgets for portal-wide use via the
OpenSocial Gadget Publisher.}
\end{figure}

Clicking \emph{Actions} next to the gadget enables you to edit, refresh,
change permissions on, or delete the gadget. Here is a brief listing of
what these four buttons do:

\emph{Edit:} allows you to change the URL or category.

\emph{Refresh:} manually refreshes the gadget cache to reflect changes
that have been made to the gadget that may not currently be displayed in
the portlet.

\emph{Permissions:} gives you the basic \emph{View}, \emph{Update},
\emph{Delete}, and \emph{Permissions} options for each role on your
site.

\emph{Delete:} removes the listing for the gadget.

If you navigate to \emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Applications} $\rightarrow$\emph{Gadgets},
you should see the \emph{To-Do List} gadget.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/15-opensocial-4.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.16: You can conveniently list your gadgets within the
\emph{Gadgets} category.}
\end{figure}

In the next section, we'll demonstrate how to share OpenSocial gadgets
with other sites.

\subsection{Sharing OpenSocial
Gadgets}\label{sharing-opensocial-gadgets}

OpenSocial consists of a set of APIs for social networking. Liferay
implements the OpenSocial standard, so you can be assured that your
gadgets run on Liferay. That also means gadgets hosted by a Liferay
Portal instance can be deployed and run in any standard OpenSocial
container. It may be beneficial for you to share gadgets from your
Liferay server with other sites, such as iGoogle. Google's iGoogle lets
users customize their own page and add gadgets to their page. Your
Liferay Portal users can share their portlets and other OpenSocial
gadgets on iGoogle or any other OpenSocial-compatible site. Let's try
this now.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Warning:} The iGoogle site was removed from
Google on November 1, 2013:
\url{https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2664197}. 
Sharing your Liferay OpenSocial gadgets to iGoogle is longer possible. A 
third-party replacement can be found at \url{http://www.igoogleportal.com}.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}
For our example, we'll share Liferay's \emph{Loan Calculator} on
iGoogle.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Add the \emph{Loan Calculator} portlet onto your Liferay page
\item
  Click the gear icon in the upper right corner of the portlet and
  select \emph{Configuration}
\item
  Select the \emph{Sharing} tab and the \emph{OpenSocial Gadget} sub-tab
\item
  Check the box labeled \emph{Allow users to add Loan Calculator to
  iGoogle}. Also, replace ``localhost:8080'' with the name of your
  public domain and port.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/15-opensocial-7.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 10.17: Allow users to add your portlet as an
  OpenSocial Gadget in iGoogle.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Click Save
\item
  Close out the window and navigate back to the wrench icon in the upper
  right corner of your portlet. There is a new option named \emph{Add to
  iGoogle} available. Click on this button to add your portlet to your
  iGoogle page.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/15-opensocial-8.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 10.18: Users simply click the \emph{Add to iGoogle}
  button to add your portlet to their iGoogle page.}
  \end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

Your portlet is now available on your iGoogle page!

By going through this process, Liferay shared the URL of your portlet to
iGoogle. The URL you provided is unique to your specific instance of the
portlet. This allows you to share multiple instances of the same portlet
as different Google Gadgets.

You could use this sharing capability to let users view what's happening
on your portal at a glance. As you can imagine, you can share all kinds
of information from your portal gadgets and portlets with your various
circles of friends, colleagues, and fellow community members.

\subsection{Gadget Personalization}\label{gadget-personalization}

Liferay allows gadgets on your site to be personalized with data from
third-party applications. Some of the third-party sites that authorize
users to access application data include Evernote, Facebook, Google,
Netflix, Photobucket, and Yahoo. Of course, many users feel
uncomfortable giving away their private credentials to access these
applications. Fortunately, Liferay allows you to use \emph{OAuth} to
protect your credentials while you access resources on these sites.

OAuth is an open standard that authorizes third-party applications to
interact with a user's resources. Users can share their private
resources from one site with another site without supplying typical
credentials, such as their user name and password. OAuth uses request
and access tokens as well as a token secret to authenticate the users of
your gadget. For more information on OAuth and how it can be
incorporated into your portal, visit the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/oauth}{OAuth} section of
this guide.

Let's see how to implement OAuth in a custom OpenSocial gadget!

\subsubsection{OAuth Admin
Configuration}\label{oauth-admin-configuration}

OpenSocial defines a specification that allows gadgets to incorporate
OAuth to access protected resources from service providers. A brief
example is provided to demonstrate how easy it is to leverage OAuth
within gadgets on your site.

For this example, we'll set up a demo Twitter account gadget using
OAuth. First we must configure your gadget. Follow the steps below to
acquire the consumer key and secret given by the service provider.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Similar to previous examples, add the Twitter Demo gadget to your
  page. Go to the Control Panel and click on \emph{OpenSocial Gadget
  Publisher} under the \emph{Apps} heading. Click \emph{Publish Gadget}
  and insert the Twitter Demo URL:

\begin{verbatim}
https://raw.github.com/dejuknow/opensocial-gadgets/master/Twitter/Twitter.xml
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Click \emph{Save}
\item
  For OAuth-enabled gadgets, you can select the \emph{Manage OAuth}
  button from the \emph{Actions} tab. Select \emph{Manage OAuth} for
  your Twitter gadget. As shown below, you have several options under
  ``twitter'' that you must fill in to configure your gadget. You must
  also register your gadget with Twitter to access the Consumer Key and
  Consumer Secret.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/15-opensocial-9.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 10.19: Twitter allows you to manage OAuth for your
  Twitter gadget.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Go to \url{https://dev.twitter.com} and click \emph{Get started with
  the platform} to begin registering your gadget.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/15-opensocial-11.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 10.20: Select \emph{Get started with the platform}
  from within the \emph{Developers} page.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Navigate to the \emph{REST API} heading and click \emph{Manage \&
  create your applications}. Then click \emph{Create New App}.
\item
  Fill in the \emph{Name}, \emph{Description}, and \emph{Website} fields
  with what you prefer.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    For the \emph{Callback URL} field, enter Liferay's default callback
    URL\footnote{\url{http://myLiferayServer/opensocial-portlet/gadgets/oauthcallback}}.
    Replace ``myLiferayServer'' with an appropriate value---for this
    demonstration, use your machine's local loopback address: 127.0.0.1:8080.
  \item
    Finally, select the \emph{Create your Twitter application} tab at
    the bottom of the page.
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/15-opensocial-12.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 10.21: Fill in \emph{Application Details} to setup
  connectivity between your Twitter gadget and your portal.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  You are given the OAuth setting that you need to configure your gadget
  on Liferay. Copy the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret to your
  clipboard.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/15-opensocial-13.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 10.22: Here are the \emph{Consumer Key} and
  \emph{Consumer Secret} (value is blacked out for security reasons).}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Enter your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret under the \emph{Manage
  OAuth} that you navigated to earlier. Also, select
  \texttt{HMAC\_SYMMETRIC} for the \emph{Key Type} and then click
  \emph{Save}.

  Note: Liferay offers \texttt{PLAINTEXT} and \texttt{RSA\_PRIVATE} as
  alternative key types. HMAC symmetric and RSA private are commonly
  used production key types, whereas plain text should never be used in
  real-world settings.
\item
  Navigate to the \emph{Settings} tab and under \emph{Application Type},
  select \emph{Read and Write}. Also, select the \emph{Allow this
  application to be used to Sign in with Twitter} checkbox. Then click
  \emph{Update this Twitter application's settings} at the bottom of the
  page.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/15-opensocial-19.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 10.23: Select the \emph{Read and Write} option to
  enable two way communication.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Navigate back to the \emph{Details} tab and, at the bottom of the
  page, click \emph{Create my access token}.
\end{enumerate}

Congratulations! Your Twitter gadget is now configured with OAuth.

Next, we'll configure the gadget within Liferay Portal.

\subsection{Incorporating OAuth Within Your
Site}\label{incorporating-oauth-within-your-site}

Now that your gadget is registered with Twitter and is configured with
OAuth, you can add it to your Liferay Portal. The OAuth client you
configured in the previous section allows users to protect their
credentials while accessing resources on your site. For this section,
we'll demonstrate how to add the OAuth-configured gadget to your page.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Navigate to \emph{My Private Pages} and click \emph{Add} →
  \emph{More\ldots{}} $\rightarrow$\emph{Twitter Gadget}. If your gadget is
  configured correctly, it should appear like this:

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/15-opensocial-14.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 10.24: Your OAuth configured Twitter gadget awaits
  personalization with your Twitter account.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Click on \emph{Personalize this gadget} to be redirected to the
  service provider.
\item
  Fill in your Twitter user name and password and select \emph{Authorize
  app}

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/15-opensocial-15.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 10.25: Authorizing your OpenSocial application to use
  your account is straightforward.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Your Twitter Gadget should now show your last 20 tweets from your
  timeline. Your gadget should look similar to the snapshot below:

  \item
  Using this gadget, you can tweet your current status and have it
  display on your Liferay site and Twitter page. To change the amount of
  tweets displayed, click on the wrench icon in the upper right corner
  and select \emph{Configuration}. Under the \emph{Setup} tab, you can
  type the number of tweets to display.

\item
  Lastly, you can tweet and view your Twitter timeline. The snapshot
  below displays what the Twitter Gadget looks like when tweeting.

As you can see, OAuth is easy to configure and offers users the freedom
to securely add valuable data from third-party sites.

\subsection{Creating and Editing OpenSocial
Gadgets}\label{creating-and-editing-opensocial-gadgets}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/15-opensocial-16.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 10.26: Check out your Twitter gadget timeline!}
  \end{figure}

OpenSocial gadgets are XML documents, so as part of Liferay's OpenSocial
integration, a gadget editor is included. The gadget editor is a
complete development environment for gadgets providing syntax
highlighting, a preview function, undo/redo options, and built in tabs
for working on multiple gadgets at once. You can also organize and
manage gadgets through a simple file manager embedded into the portlet.
To access the gadget editor, go to \emph{Site Administration} →
\emph{Configuration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Content} and click \emph{OpenSocial Gadget
Editor}.

Once you have created and saved a gadget using the editor, click on the
wrench next to the file to rename, delete, publish or get the URL for
your gadget. If you want to display your gadget somewhere, click
\emph{Publish} to choose a category and display your gadget in the
application menu or click \emph{Show URL} to get a URL to display your
gadget on any site that supports OpenSocial.

In addition to the social interactions that you can create on your
portal, Liferay can integrate with some other popular social networks.
This enables you to leverage their power and popularity for your
portal's content.

\section{Integrating with Facebook}\label{integrating-with-facebook}

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/15-opensocial-17.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 10.27: Configure the number of Tweets to display.}
  \end{figure}
Facebook is currently the number one social network in the world with
somewhere over 1 billion active users. If you're trying to build
acommunity on your portal, you don't want to neglect a bridge to that
many possible users. With that in mind, Liferay provides a few easy ways
for you to integrate your portal with Facebook.

\subsection{Facebook Sign On}\label{facebook-sign-on}

Like many web sites you may visit, any portal running on Liferay can be
set up to use Facebook for sign in. This makes it easier for users to
sign in to your site, since they won't need to remember another user
name and password, For more information on setting up Facebook sign on,
see chapter 15.

\subsection{Using your Portlets as Facebook
Applications}\label{using-your-portlets-as-facebook-applications}

You can add any Liferay portlet as an application on Facebook. To do
this, you must first get a developer key. A link for doing this is
provided to you in the Facebook tab in any portlet's Configuration
screen. You will have to create the application on Facebook and get the
key and canvas page URL from Facebook. Once you've done this you can
copy and paste their values into the Facebook tab. Your portlet is now
available on Facebook.

This integration enables you to make things like Message Boards,
Calendars, Wikis, and other content on your portal available to a much
larger audience (unless you already have a billion users on your site,
in which case, kudos to you).

\section{Integrating with Twitter}\label{integrating-with-twitter}

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/15-opensocial-20.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 10.28: Here is your Twitter gadget just the way you
  like it!}
  \end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

Liferay Portal also provides integration with Twitter via the Twitter
app on \href{http://liferay.com/marketplace}{Liferay Marketplace}. Once
you register your Twitter username with the app, your tweets are shown
in your Activities portlet along with your activity feed. Make sure that
you get the appropriate version of the app for your Liferay instance.
The Twitter CE app is intended for Liferay Portal CE, while the Twitter
EE app is intended for Liferay Portal EE.

There are two ways to register your Twitter username with the app after
you install it. The first is through the Twitter portlet after you add
it to a page. Click the link in the portlet and then enter your Twitter
username in the Twitter field. Alternatively, from the Dockbar select
\emph{User} $\rightarrow$\emph{My Account} $\rightarrow$\emph{Social Network} and then enter
your Twitter username in the Twitter field.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/social-network-accounts.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.29: Register your Twitter account.}
\end{figure}

It's important to note that your tweets are displayed \emph{only} in an
Activities portlet. If you want your tweets to show up on a page, there
must be an Activities portlet on it. Also, you need to wait a few
minutes after registering your Twitter username for your tweets to show
up. Keep in mind that the Activities portlet shows your tweets in order
according to the date and time that you originally made them. Therefore,
if you haven't tweeted in a while, then your tweets might be pushed off
the Activities feed by more recent activity. You can change the number
of items shown in the Activities feed in the portlet's Configuration.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/activities-feed-tweets.png}
\caption{\\Figure 10.30: Your tweets are displayed in an Activities
portlet.}
\end{figure}

\section{Summary}\label{summary-10}

Websites like Facebook and Twitter have attracted hundreds of millions
of users by simply giving users a way to connect and communicate with
each other. With Liferay, you have the power to either build a portal
around social features or enhance a portal built around content and
collaboration by providing users with the tools to connect and interact.

To get started, you can use a selection of portlets designed to make
users' personal public pages a place where they can interact with each
other by learning about other users and communicate using a simple
messaging system. Using the now ubiquitous concept of ``friends,'' users
can also form a long term connection with other users they frequently
work with or with whom they share similar interests.

Outside of users' personal pages, you have a variety of portlets, like
the activity portlets, which are designed to help users identify other
users that might be working on similar projects, and keep track of
what's going on around the portal. You can even use the Social Activity
feature to give credit where credit is due and recognize the users who
contribute the most.

Reaching even further out, Liferay provides integration with other sites
and services that enable you to connect with users outside of your
portal, either by pulling content from other websites using OpenSocial
integration, or by pushing content on your portal out to a broader
audience using Facebook integration. We've outlined the tools you have
available, now it's up to you to leverage Liferay's Social Networking
features in the way that best fits your portal.

\chapter{Using Web Forms and Dynamic Data
Lists}\label{using-web-forms-and-dynamic-data-lists}

As needs change in business and organizations, the technology used to
fulfill those needs must adapt as well. People use electronic means to
do things that years ago were done using manual processes. For example,
you may want your team to sign up on your web site for a holiday party.
Or maybe every fall, you need to put up a job posting board, only
allowing administrators to create new job posts. Maybe you want to allow
users to manage a notebook or To-Do list on their private pages. In all
of these cases, you want to enter in custom sets of data, allow your
users to add their information, and be able to access the set of data.

In the past, you'd need to be a developer to accomplish any of this.
Today, you can do it without writing a single line of code. Enter
Liferay's \emph{Dynamic Data Lists}. This is an easy way to create,
aggregate, and display new data types. Data Lists are flexible enough to
handle all types of data, and you don't have to write any code. Simply
put, Liferay gives you the power to perform the following actions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Define your own data definitions
\item
  Create new lists from those definitions
\item
  Customize the input forms for ease of use
\item
  Customize the output format
\item
  Integrate lists into Workflow
\end{itemize}

All of this capability can be easily distilled into two concepts: data
defining and data displaying. These data lists are dynamic for a reason:
they are flexible and powerful. Whether you want to collect simple input
from the user or develop an entire data entry system for real estate
listings, Dynamic Data Lists have your use case covered. Combined with
the flexibility provided through templates and the power of languages
like Velocity, entire applications can be built in a short time.

\section{Building a List Platform in Liferay and Defining Data
Types}\label{building-a-list-platform-in-liferay-and-defining-data-types}

To expand and extend the social capabilities of our site, we want to
build a new, radical platform on Liferay: custom-built lists that users
can share and collaborate on with their friends (or enemies, depending
on their Social Relation type). Marketing has come up with a great name
for our new service: \texttt{list.it}. Our beautiful \texttt{list.it}
dashboard will give users the power to generate their own lists, see the
lists of their friends and tally the results of certain types of lists
(surveys, anyone?). Liferay makes this as simple as throwing some
Dynamic Data List Display and Form portlets on the public and private
pages of users' personal sites.

When new users log in to \texttt{list.it}, they are going to want to
build a few lists for themselves. Chances are, many of the lists they
would want to create--to do lists, shopping lists and memos come to
mind--are already defined in the portal. All the user has to do is
create a new list, choose that pre-defined data type, and have at it! A
number of data definitions ship with the portal's default site to help
you get started. These include \emph{To Do}, \emph{Issues Tracking},
\emph{Meeting Minutes}, and \emph{Contacts}. Use these on their own to
generate new data lists or tweak them to fit your use case.

If none of the built-in data definitions suits your needs, you can
define your own. Perhaps we want to allow our \texttt{list.it} users
(who would probably call themselves ``list-ers'' or ``list-ies'') to
create their own data types for lists they create. In this case, they
would need to have unfettered access to the content of their private
user site where they can create a new data type.

Using data lists to outline a new data model is as simple as point and
click. You now have a \texttt{list.it} account and have been dying to
bug your friends and family to sign up for ``volunteer'' work: helping
you move into a new apartment. Using an intuitive visual editor, you can
quickly draw up the skeleton for that volunteer list in minutes. Since
data lists exemplify a unique type of content for your site, you can
find them in the Content section Site Administration area of the Control
Panel. To manage the dynamic data lists of your site, click \emph{Admin}
from the Dockbar and select \emph{Content}. Then click on \emph{Dynamic
Data Lists}.

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/05-ddl-control-panel.png}
\caption{\\Figure 11.1: You can manage dynamic data lists from the Content
section of the Site Administration area of the Control Panel.}
\end{wrapfigure}

From the Dynamic Data Lists portlet in the Control Panel, you can either
click \emph{Add} to create a new dynamic data list from an existing data
type or you can click \emph{Manage Data Definitions} to add or edit data
definitions. Liferay 6.2 introduced the \emph{Copy} action which copies
the DDM templates associated with an existing data definition. You can
access the Copy button by navigating to \emph{Manage Data Definitions}
and clicking \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Copy} next to a data definition. The
Copy menu includes options for copying the form and displaying templates
associated with the data definition. We'll discuss how to manage and
create form and display templates later in the chapter. When you're
finished, the copied data definition can be accessed in the \emph{Manage
Data Definitions} menu. The Copy feature lets you create new data
definitions based on existing ones. You can use the copied version as a
checkpoint and work off of it.

If you want to use a new data type, you need to create a definition for
it. From the Dynamic Data Lists portlet in the Control Panel, click
\emph{Manage Data Definitions} and click the \emph{Add} button. The
first thing you should enter is a name for the definition and a
description. Create a new data definition called \emph{Volunteer
Sign-Up}. When creating a new data definition, you have a palette of
fields to lay out, as well as a blank canvas to construct the
definition. The interface looks similar to creating and editing web
content structures covered previously. Let's explore the different data
types at our disposal:

\textbf{Boolean:} presents a checkbox to the user and stores either a
\texttt{true} (checked) or \texttt{false} (unchecked) based on state.

\textbf{Date:} a preformatted text field that displays a convenient date
picker to assist in selecting the desired date. The format for the date
is governed by the current locale.

\textbf{Decimal:} similar to \emph{Number}, except that it requires a
decimal point (\texttt{.}) be present.

\textbf{Documents and Media:} select an existing uploaded document to
attach to the data record. Also has the ability to upload documents into
the Document Library.

\textbf{HTML:} An area that uses a WYSIWYG editor to enhance the
content.

\textbf{Integer:} similar to \emph{Number}, except that it constrains
user input to non-fractional numbers.

\textbf{Link to Page:} Inserts a link to another page in the same site.

\textbf{Number:} a text box that only accepts numbers as inputs, but
puts no constraints on the kind of number entered.

\textbf{Radio:} presents the user with a list of options to choose from
using radio button inputs. Values are stored as strings. Similar to
\emph{Select}.

\textbf{Select:} a selection of options for the user to choose from
using a combo box. Can be configured to allow multiple selections,
unlike \emph{Radio}.

\textbf{Text:} a simple text field for any string input.

\textbf{Text Box:} a large text box for long text input.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-data-definition-screen.png}
\caption{\\Figure 11.2: You can combine many different kinds of fields to
form a list definition and you can configure various settings and
properties for each field.}
\end{figure}

Using that reference as a nice cheat-sheet, you can now create the data
type you need for ``Volunteer Work Sign-Up.'' Use a \emph{Text} type for
the name. For all the tasks your friends and family can volunteer to do
for you, use \emph{Select} to allow users to choose from a list of
tasks. Finally, don't forget a \emph{Documents and Media} field users
can upload images of themselves. After all, how much more
official-feeling and fun is it if you can print out some nifty badges?
To add these fields, drag them from the palette on the left to the work
area on the right.

When creating data definitions, you can also customize the appearance of
the input fields and provide helpful tips and hints for those entering
data. Some data types have specific configuration options but all have
some in common. The following properties can be edited in three ways: 1)
by double-clicking on any field, 2) by clicking the wrench icon in the
upper-right corner of the field or 3) by clicking the \emph{Settings}
tab when the field is selected. Let's take a look at the properties you
can edit for each of these field types:

\textbf{Type:} Lists the type of field placed in the definition. This is
not editable but is available to reference from a display template.

\textbf{Field Label:} Sets the text that can be displayed with the
field. This is the human-readable text that the user sees.

\textbf{Show Label:} When set to \emph{Yes}, the label is shown with the
form field.

\textbf{Required:} When set to \emph{Yes}, this field must have data in
it for a new entry to be submitted (not available for Boolean).

\textbf{Name:} The name of the field internally, automatically
generated. Since this is the variable name that you can read the data
from in a display template, you should give a more memorable name here.

\textbf{Predefined Value:} If you would like example data or a default
value for the user to start with, enter it here. The field's value
defaults to this when adding a new entry.

\textbf{Tip:} Each field can have a small help icon, with a tooltip
attached that displays helpful information. If you would like to provide
text for the tooltip you may enter it here.

\textbf{Indexable:} When set to \emph{Yes}, Liferay is able to index
your field for search.

\textbf{Repeatable:} When set to \emph{Yes}, the field is repeatable.
Your users can then add as many copies of this field as they like.

\textbf{Width:} Sets the visual width of the form on the page. It does
not affect the values that are stored. Possible values are \emph{Small},
\emph{Medium} and \emph{Large} (not available for Boolean, Documents and
Media, Radio, and Select).

\textbf{Multiple:} When set to \emph{Yes}, allows the user to select
more than one option. This defaults to no (only available for Select).

\textbf{Options:} Changes the options available for selection. You're
able to add and remove options as well as edit each individual option's
display name and VALUE (ONLY AVAILABLE FOR RADIO AND SELECT).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-data-definition-field-properties.png}
\caption{\\Figure 11.3: You can edit the properties of data fields. This
allows you to, for example, add and edit selectable options for the
\emph{Task} drop-down menu on the Spring Move-In Sign Up form.}
\end{figure}

In addition to dragging the fields around to create your desired forms,
you can stack inputs within inputs by dragging a field within another
field. You can organize your data into unlimited levels of hierarchy,
creating the clearest, most logical data model. There is also a
duplicate button on each field (the middle button), allowing you to
easily clone any field as many times as you need.

Another method to edit your data definition is switching to
\emph{Source} mode and manually customizing your structure by editing
its XML file. You'll notice by default the \emph{View} mode is selected.
Click the \emph{Source} tab to switch to Source mode. This method is for
the more experienced developers.

Data definitions also have the capability of inheriting characteristics
from other definitions. When a parent data definition is configured, the
child definition inherits the parent's fields and settings. Using this
feature is helpful when you want to make a similar data definition to
one you've already created. For instance, if you'd like to create an
advanced sign-up sheet in addition to a regular sign-up sheet, you can
simply inherit the characteristics of the regular sheet and only add the
additional fields necessary for the advanced sheet. When the advanced
sheet is configured, it will display its parent's fields in addition to
its own fields.

After you've saved your data definition, Liferay provides a WebDAV URL
and a static URL. These values access the XML source of your data
definition. To obtain these values, return to your data definition after
it has been saved. To learn more about WebDAV or if you'd like to see
WebDAV in action, visit the \emph{Document Management} chapter's
\emph{WebDAV access} chapter.

That really covers the basic tools that users of \texttt{list.it} need
to get rolling with an unlimited array of custom types. Plus, you can
always come back and change your form. If you find you needed to add
some more information, simply come back to the data definition and fix
it. All your data lists that use it are then instantly updated with the
new or changed fields.

All that's left to do is build a new data list and let your users play
with it.

\section{Creating Data Lists}\label{creating-data-lists}

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/05-ddl-add-record.png}
\caption{\\Figure 11.4: You can enter a new data record by clicking on
\emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Content} from the Dockbar, clicking on
\emph{Dynamic Data Lists}, clicking on an existing list, and then
clicking on the \emph{Add} button next to the list's name.
Alternatively, you can install the Dynamic Data List Form portlet, add
it to a page, and configure it to allow users to submit new data records
for a lists.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Building out new lists really isn't all that different from creating new
pieces of web content. Just as you can create new Web Content Structures
to control the input of a particular type of web content, you can use
Data List Definitions to control the input of new list types. Similarly,
just as you create a new piece of web content, selecting the Structure
you would like to use with it, \texttt{list.it} users (we'll call them
\emph{Listies}) choose the Definition they want to use when creating a
new list. Now that a data definition is in place, all that remains is to
create a new data list to capture the information we're going after.
This is the easiest step in creating the list, with only a few clicks
between a data definition and robust data entry and delivery.

To create a new volunteer list with the ``Volunteer Sign-Up''
definition:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  From the Dockbar, click on \emph{Admin} \&rrar; \emph{Content} and
  then on \emph{Dynamic Data Lists}.
\item
  Click on \emph{Add} to create a new list based on a data definition,
  which in our case is the volunteer sign-up.
\item
  Give the data list a name, like \emph{Spring Move-In Sign Up} and a
  description to assist administrative users in the future.
\item
  Last and most importantly, click \emph{Select} under the \emph{Data
  Definition} section--this is where you set the data model that drives
  this list.
\item
  Choose the \emph{Volunteer Sign-Up} data definition you created, then
  click \emph{Save}.
\end{enumerate}

Now that you've created your brand new volunteer list, you can pester
everyone you know to sign up. But what would it look like for them to
add an entry to this list? The data definition you've previously created
(or selected) defines the layout as well, which means the form looks
just the way you laid it out.

But how will this data appear? How will my awesome, new Volunteer
Sign-Up sheet or that boring Jobs Listing look? The answers to these
pressing, burning questions bring us to the mecca that is the display
side of this equation.

\subsection{Using Data List Forms}\label{using-data-list-forms}

A nice way to enable people to use your forms is the Dynamic Data List
Form portlet. This portlet is tailored to entering new records. When you
deploy that data list for your users to sign up for a retreat, or your
family members to volunteer to help you move, using the data list form
allows you to simplify the sign-up process and hide the contents of the
list.

The Dynamic Data List Form portlet is not a core Liferay portlet like
the Web Content Display portlet. However, it's freely available on
\href{http://www.liferay.com/marketplace}{Liferay Marketplace}. Just
search for and install the Dynamic Data List Form (or Dynamic Data List
Form EE) portlet. Using the Dynamic Data List Form is similar to using
the Web Content Display portlet: just set it up, point it to a list
(either existing or new) and let it go. This is very easy to do.

To display a list inside the portlet, add the Dynamic Data List Form
portlet to a page: Click the \emph{Add} button on the left side of the
screen, click on \emph{Applications}, search for \emph{Dynamic Data List
Form}, then click \emph{Add} next to its name. With the portlet on the
page, click on the \emph{Select List} gear icon. This opens a
configuration popup, where you can select a list to use for the form
entries. When configuring the portlet, make sure to check the
\emph{Allow Multiple Submissions} box if you'd like users to be able to
add multiple records for a list. If this box is not checked, once a user
fills out an entry, the portlet displays a message stating that a record
has already been submitted. If the \emph{Allow Multiple Submissions} box
is checked, each time a user visits your page with the Sign-Up form, the
Dynamic Data List Form portlet presents them with a form to fill out.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} If you want to allow guests to submit DDL forms, you'll
need to enable the \emph{Allow Multiple Submissions} feature. Liferay
treats the Guest user as one user. Therefore, if a guest submits a DDL
form, Liferay assumes the Guest user filled out their one form and it
won't allow any other guests to submit a form. Thus, allowing the Guest
user to submit multiple submissions allows all your guests to submit DDL
forms.

\end{roundedframe}
Once records have been submitted for lists, you can publish the lists
anywhere in your portal. Read on to find out more about that.

\subsection{Using Default Displays}\label{using-default-displays}

Lists are published in the portal through the Dynamic Data List Display
portlet. If Listies don't customize the display, their lists look
something like this:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-ddl-list-display.png}
\caption{\\Figure 11.5: The default data list display in the Control Panel
shows the list's records and allows record to added, edited, or
removed.}
\end{figure}

This isn't all that exciting, but it allows users to see the list's
contents, and if they have permission, to add and/or edit list items.
Within a site like \texttt{list.it}, this type of interaction is used
for display-only lists that the user chooses to expose to others, or for
the user's own private lists. But you can improve the display. You can
show the data in a spreadsheet, so you can view the responses to your
Volunteer Sign-Up in a comfortable, easy-to-read format. The Dynamic
Data List Display portlet provides an easy way for a user (such as a
member of a site) to interact with whatever list is active and
available.

While it's possible to ask everyone to contribute to the data list
within the control panel, it's much better to give them a simple way to
access the list. Liferay provides the Dynamic Data List Display portlet
to ease the integration of your new list onto your site. With your list
in hand, head over to the page you want and add the portlet. It works
much like the Dynamic Data List Form portlet and the Web Content Display
portlet: use the gear icon to select a list for display or use the
pen/paper icon to add a new list. The Dynamic Data List Display portlet
is a Liferay core portlet, unlike the Dynamic Data List Form portlet.
The default display spills out the contents of the list, but can be
configured to use a different display template, which is explored later
in this chapter. The two important configuration options to consider
are:

\textbf{Editable:} allows users that have permission to add new entries
to the list. By default, this is disabled and when enabled,
administrators are the only ones with add permission. To easily grant
access to other users, edit the permissions on the list you'd like to
grant access to, and grant the \texttt{Add Record} permission.

\textbf{Spreadsheet View:} displays the list in a dynamic spreadsheet
view. This allows users with permission to interact with the list in the
same way as in a standard spreadsheet program.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-ddl-spreadsheet-view.png}
\caption{\\Figure 11.6: The Dynamic Data List Display portlet allows users
to view the records belong to a list in either a standard or a
spreadsheet view. This figure shows the spreadsheet view.}
\end{figure}

Now, as useful as this default display is, and it's certainly useful for
my to do list and my memo notes, it can be an awkward way to ask my
volunteers to sign up. In fact, any time I want other Listies to
interact with my lists and contribute responses, I really just want a
simple form to show them. They don't need to see the full range of
responses. And in some cases, it can be hazardous to your health for
everyone to see the responses. Then you don't have to explain why your
sister-in-law won't work with your brother on the same task because of
his B.O. problem. For reasons like that, you'll need to customize the
data entry form or the display of the list. Liferay lets you do exactly
that using a custom \emph{form template} or \emph{display template}.

\section{Make it Pretty: Creating Custom
Displays}\label{make-it-pretty-creating-custom-displays}

When creating custom lists and data definitions, you can control not
only how the input form appears to your users but also how the list
itself displays. Eventually you may realize you need to create another
sign-up sheet but you don't need the same level of detail provided by
the Volunteer Sign-Up data definition you created. Liferay empowers you
to customize both the input and output of your lists to unlimited
levels. Dynamic data lists provide two areas to customize: form
templates and display templates. This covers the forms of lists
(\emph{form templates}), as well as the display of the list contents
(\emph{display templates}).

\subsection{Form Templates}\label{form-templates}

The default data entry form is the entire data model you created in a
data definition, including required and optional fields. Listies who
create new lists using a data definition will see every item in that
definition on the input form. What if, however, you want a quick sign-up
form to find out who's coming to dinner tonight? Using a form template
you can customize the form's display any way you want. You can limit the
fields displayed for entry or change the order of elements. To access
and create new templates, go to the Dockbar and click \emph{Admin} →
\emph{Content}, click on Dynamic Data Lists, click on \emph{Manage Data
Definitions}, then click on the \emph{Actions} button next to your data
definition of choice and select \emph{Manage Templates}. When you click
on \emph{Add Form Template}, you're presented with the same kind of
graphical, drag-and-drop interface used for creating the data
definition. Move items around, delete unwanted fields from view and save
when ready.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Note: Form templates were called \emph{detail templates} prior to
Liferay 6.2.
\vspace{32pt}
\end{roundedframe}
Note that data definitions can have multiple templates. You can choose
the template you want to use for display in either a dynamic data list
display or a dynamic data list form portlet (see below). You should
create as many templates as you might need, and you can prototype them
in the portlets to see how each feels.

Now your friends and enemies alike will be impressed with your
\texttt{list.it} skills. It may look to the untrained eye like you've
single-handedly created three or four different data types for your
lists but you know better. You used the power that form templates
provide, using one data model that encompasses the maximum information
you might need (like preferred activity, favorite color and ideal
schedule). Then you quickly churned out four different form templates
with a few mouse clicks. Now that you have such a vast amount of data
collection options, how will you display them? However you want, as
you're about to find out.

\subsection{Display Templates}\label{display-templates}

For every data definition, you have an unlimited number of displays you
can create. If you created a special ``Thanksgiving Dinner Sign-Up''
list using your ``Volunteer Sign-Up'' definition, you wouldn't want to
confuse fellow Listies by displaying data fields you never asked for.
``Preferred task?'' a friend might say, ``I don't remember seeing
\emph{that} on the sign-up form!'' To avoid such embarrassing
situations, you should create a custom display to match that list.
Taking it even further, you could provide a fancy, JavaScript-driven
image carousel preview of all the attendees of the party. This would
complement your other displays and be another bragging right on
\texttt{list.it}. Display templates give you the power to do all this
and more.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Note: Display templates were called \emph{list templates} prior to
Liferay 6.2.
\vspace{32pt}
\end{roundedframe}
Just like form templates, display templates are found in the Manage
Templates section of a data definition. With display templates you can
customize the display of a list in precisely the same way as you can
customize web content. Display templates can be written in FreeMarker or
Velocity, pulling data from the data definition in the same way that web
content templates pull data from their structures. Also similar to web
content templates, display templates can be embedded in other display
templates. This allows for reusable code, JS library imports, or macros
which will be imported by Velocity or FreeMarker templates in the
system. Embedding display templates provides a more efficient process
when you have a multitude of similar data definitions. Just import an
embedded display template and work off of it for your new display
template. We'll look at a simple example, but for more information on
using template scripts to pull data from a backing structure, see web
content templates in chapter 3.

The first thing we need to do is create a new display template for our
``Volunteer Sign-Up'' data definition. As with many other features in
Liferay, there are multiple ways to do this, depending on your context.

From the Dynamic Data List Display portlet:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Navigate to the page with your DDL Display portlet and make sure your
  list is selected in the portlet's configuration.
\item
  Find the \emph{Add Display Template} icon on the bottom-left corner of
  the portlet window and click it to create a new template. If you don't
  see the icon, sign in as a user with permission to create templates.
\end{enumerate}

From the Dockbar/Control Panel:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Click on \emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Content}.
\item
  Navigate to \emph{Dynamic Data Lists} $\rightarrow$\emph{Manage Data
  Definitions}.
\item
  Find your data definition in the list, then click \emph{Actions} →
  \emph{Manage Templates}.
\item
  Now you can click on \emph{Add Display Template} to create a new
  template.
\end{enumerate}

Fill out the form with a name and a description. Next, choose a
templating language. Just like web content templates, you can choose
between FreeMarker or Velocity. There is no functional difference
between the two. Once you choose the script language, you can upload a
template file or use the display template editor to type in a script
manually. Inside the editor, you have access to a palette featuring
common variables related to your selected template language.
Additionally, you can hover your pointer over a variable in the palette
for a more detailed description. To place a variable into the display
template code, position your cursor where you want it placed, and click
the variable name in the palette. Another useful tool in the display
template editor is the autocomplete feature. In a FreeMarker template,
it can be invoked by typing \emph{\$\{} which opens a drop-down menu of
common variables. Upon selecting one of the variables, the editor
inserts the variable into your display template code.

We want to write a FreeMarker template to give us a summary of who is
helping on the tasks in our move. To do that, we need to access the
records for the list and pull out the name and task for each volunteer.
Within the template, we have access to a number of helper variables to
find out what records we have access to:

\begin{verbatim}
reserved_ddm_structure_id

reserved_record_set_description

reserved_record_set_id

reserved_record_set_name
\end{verbatim}

Inside a template, these variables give us the ID for the record set
(that contains all of the volunteers in our list), as well as the name,
description and data definition. We can easily retrieve all the records
through a service call to \texttt{DDLRecordLocalService}. To gain access
to this service, we need to use a helper utility called
\texttt{serviceLocator} that retrieves an instance of the service for
us. Once we have the service, we can retrieve the list of records (our
list of volunteers). Accessing the service with the
\texttt{serviceLocator} can be done with the following line of code:

\begin{verbatim}
<#assign DDLRecordLocalService =
    serviceLocator.findService(
    "com.liferay.portlet.dynamicdatalists.service.DDLRecordLocalService")>
\end{verbatim}

We store a handle to our service in \texttt{DDLRecordLocalService} so we
can use the service to retrieve our list of volunteers:

\begin{verbatim}
<#assign records = DDLRecordLocalService.getRecords(reserved_record_set_id)>
\end{verbatim}

Now that we have our records, we can iterate through the list and
display the data from each record that we want to show. To access a
field from a record entry (such as the volunteer's name), we call the
\texttt{getFieldValue} method and pass in the field's name. Each dynamic
data list record has a number of other similar methods (see the
\texttt{com.life\-ray.port\-let.dy\-na\-mic\-da\-ta\-lists.mo\-del.DDL\-Rec\-ord} interface\footnote{\url{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs}} but you'll probably
use \texttt{getFieldValue} most often. This method returns the content
of the field.

\begin{verbatim}
${cur_record.getFieldValue("name")}
   
\end{verbatim}

Now all we have to do is set the results in some appealing way. In this
example, we've made it very simple by using an unordered list for the
results (\texttt{\textless{}ul\textgreater{}}). Here is the complete
source for the template:

\begin{verbatim}
<h1>Task Summary</h1>

Here are the tasks that people have signed up for on "${reserved_record_set_name}".

<#assign DDLRecordLocalService = 
   serviceLocator.findService(
     "com.liferay.portlet.dynamicdatalists.service.DDLRecordLocalService")>

<#assign records = DDLRecordLocalService.getRecords(reserved_record_set_id)>

<ul>
<#if records?has_content>
   <#list records as cur_record>
       <li>
       <em>${cur_record.getFieldValue("name")}</em> 
          will help with ${cur_record.getFieldValue("task")}
       </li>
   </#list>
</#if>
</ul>
\end{verbatim}

Once you've typed the template's source into the editor window, click
\emph{Save} to save the display template. With the display template
selected, your list display can now be a summary of tasks as shown
below.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-ddl-list-template.png}
\caption{\\Figure 11.7: This display template provides a list of users
who've volunteered along with the tasks for which they volunteered.}
\end{figure}

All the knowledge you have accrued through building out your
award-winning content can be brought to bear in display templates. With
the full power of FreeMarker or Velocity templates at your fingertips,
you have easy access to all the data in the list, as well as the full
complement of helper methods and the Alloy UI JavaScript library to make
easy work of dynamic displays.

If you're not a Listie and you happen to be deploying custom lists in an
environment that requires approval from other users, then it's not
enough to just create the list and display a form. What you need is a
real integration with workflow. Workflow integrates smoothly with
Dynamic Data Lists.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/05-ddl-add-workflow.png}
\caption{\\Figure 11.8: Once the workflow plugin has been installed, you
can choose a workflow when creating a new dynamic data list.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Using Workflow}\label{using-workflow}

Liferay integrates the powerful features of workflow and the data
capabilities of dynamic data lists in \emph{Kaleo Forms}. Workflow is
not enabled in the dynamic data list portlets by default, so you can
focus on the core task of building custom forms backed by a data list.
After this is done, you can deploy custom workflows to the form and its
data. Though Kaleo Forms is only available in Liferay EE, you can still
apply a workflow to a list when creating it in Liferay CE.

If you don't have a workflow engine installed, you need install the
Kaleo Web plugin. This plugin is included in the \emph{Kaleo Workflow
CE} and \emph{Kaleo Workflow EE} apps which are available from Liferay
Marketplace. To manually deploy the Kaleo workflow plugin, just copy the
plugin \texttt{.war} file to the deploy folder of you application
server. Once workflow is installed, you have a new option when creating
a list:

Choose the workflow you'd like to use. This requires that every record
must pass through the workflow process. Now if you need to preview or
edit entries as they're coming in, it's easy to integrate it into your
daily workflow.

\subsubsection{Creating a Kaleo Form}\label{creating-a-kaleo-form}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.25\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/ee-feature-web.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Kaleo Forms EE is an app that provides you with greater control over the
list creation and entry process. The Kaleo Forms EE app is available
from Liferay Marketplace. It includes both the Kaleo Designer portlet
and the Kaleo Forms portlet. The Kaleo Designer portlet provides an
easy-to-use UI that helps streamline the creation of workflow
definitions. The Kaleo Forms portlet lets you create web forms and basic
applications. The Kaleo Forms EE app bundles these applications
together, you can create workflows that govern the processing of web
forms and applications.

For lists to appeal to companies all over the world (and make your new
site not just a resounding success but attract profitable businesses),
business users must be able to control the workflow of list entry and
review those entries when made. There should also be a cool dashboard
you make all of your changes. Using Kaleo Forms, users can create lists
that follow a workflow, called a \emph{process}, or create new
\emph{entries} in a process. Creating a new process is easy,
straightforward, and effective.

\subsubsection{Starting a New Process}\label{starting-a-new-process}

Defining processes that must be followed in data collection and entry is
a fundamental part of business. Historically, this hasn't been fun or
easy but Kaleo forms makes it as easy as possible. A process is just
another way to describe a workflow that's imposed on a list. When you
place a Kaleo Forms portlet on a page, you are presented with a
dashboard with two tabs: \emph{Summary} and \emph{Processes}. The
summary view shows an inbox view which shows tasks that are assigned to
you and tasks that are assigned to your roles. The summary view also
lets you view your pending requests and your completed requests. If any
process definitions have been defined, you can submit records to a list
from the summary view. The processes view allows you to add process
definitions and manage ones that have already been created.

To build a list in Kaleo Forms with a workflow:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Add the Kaleo Forms portlet to a page.
\item
  Within the Kaleo Forms portlet, click on the \emph{Processes} tab.
\item
  Click on \emph{Add Process} and a form appears.
\item
  Enter a name and, optionally, a description. Entering a description
  helps your users understand the purpose of this process.
\item
  Select the appropriate list, workflow and forms you want to use in
  this process.
\item
  Click \emph{Save} to save your process.
\end{enumerate}

workflow process, you need to complete this form.}

While the form looks complicated, it's easy to complete. There are a few
pieces that make up a process and when you click on one, you can browse
a list and select the appropriate piece to insert.

\paragraph{Selecting an Entry
Definition}\label{selecting-an-entry-definition}

The first part of a new Kaleo process is also the simplest one: the
entry definition. This is just another way to refer to a data
definition. All of the available data definitions can be chosen,
including our awesome ``Volunteer Sign-Up List.'' Just as with normal
data lists, you can always create a new entry definition from the list
view by clicking \emph{Add}.

\paragraph{Selecting an Initial Form}\label{selecting-an-initial-form}

One of the advantages of using Kaleo forms to present your list as a
process is that it grants you complete control over the form template.
You can always use a default template, which displays all the fields
from your entry definition. You can also, however, create multiple form
templates for use in different stages of the process. When you create a
form template, you can specify what \emph{mode} to put it in:

\textbf{Create:} \emph{Create} mode gives a display for creating the
initial entry. The first stage of any workflow requires you to create a
new entry, so the initial form template must be a create mode form. All
fields marked \texttt{required} must be included on create mode forms.

\textbf{Edit:} \emph{Edit} mode is used for any stage of the workflow
process. For instance, you might want to separate information that need
not be saved from information that must. Other stages in the workflow
could be a great place to store additional, non-required, information.
Required fields can be absent from an edit mode form.

Once you have chosen an initial display template (it must be a create
mode template, not an edit template), all that's left to do is configure
the workflow for your process.

\paragraph{Selecting a Workflow}\label{selecting-a-workflow}

You can now select a workflow to apply to your new list-defined process.
Any of the available workflows can be chosen. You can also create new
ones from the selection screen. Simply choose \emph{Add Workflow} and a
Workflow Designer screen appears allowing you to define a new workflow
by dragging elements in a flow chart.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-kaleo-forms-kaleo-designer.png}
\caption{\\Figure 11.10: You'll see this form when editing or creating a
new workflow with Kaleo Designer}
\end{figure}

We'll keep ours simple; just choose \emph{Single Approver Definition}.
This gives us a starting point (entry creation) and a \emph{review}
task, which we can use to add additional information in a secondary
form.

\paragraph{Assigning Workflow Task
Forms}\label{assigning-workflow-task-forms}

Many workflows offer the option of having multiple editorial and review
stages. During these stages, you might want to offer different forms
that allow the user to add more information to the entry. Kaleo forms
offers you the opportunity to fine-tune the stages of workflow to use
different forms.

From the view to assign forms to tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Choose the workflow task by clicking on it. This selects the task in
  the chart.
\item
  In the details pane on the left-hand side there is a property called
  \texttt{Forms}. Double click to edit the \emph{value}.
\item
  Start typing the name of a form template and it appears.
\item
  Click \emph{Save} to save the form assignment.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-kaleo-forms-task-form.png}
\caption{\\Figure 11.11: When creating or editing a Kaleo process, click
\emph{Assign} under Workflow Task Forms. Then click on a task, such as
review, from the graphical view. Look for the \emph{Forms} property in
the Settings tab; you can use this property to assign a form template to
a task.}
\end{figure}

You can assign forms to as many tasks as you need until you're satisfied
with the workflow. After this stage, save the process and it's ready to
be used in Kaleo Forms.

\subsubsection{Using a Kaleo Form}\label{using-a-kaleo-form}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.25\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/ee-feature-web.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Once you have a new Kaleo Form process, you can add new entries through
the Summary tab in Kaleo Forms. Once the form is filled out and
submitted, it enters the workflow you selected for the process.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/05-kaleo-form-new-entry.png}
\caption{\\Figure 11.12: When adding a new entry to a process, you're
presented with the process's configured form template for the initial
display.}
\end{figure}

After you have created an entry, (depending on the configured workflow)
the next task in the workflow may have an additional form to complete.
If so, there will be an option to enter it:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Next to the entry in progress, click the \emph{Actions} button.
\item
  Click \emph{Complete form}.
\end{enumerate}

After the new entry has worked its way through the entire workflow, it
is added to the data set collected. The owner of that data set (who
created the Kaleo process) can view and edit the entries collected.

If you are a Listie, or a \texttt{list.it} developer, you're now
prepared to show your lists to the world. That is, in fact, the reason
you created \texttt{list.it} in the first place, right?

\section{Summary}\label{summary-11}

Our \texttt{list.it} experience is now much more enjoyable than when we
first signed up. As new Listies, we had no idea how to define our own
data types for our lists, let alone how to create a list. You can now be
the envy of your co-workers as you breeze through list and data
definition setup. Once you have your new lists set up, you can work
through building new, custom input forms for the data. Your friends on
\texttt{list.it} will thank you and wonder how you were able to
accomplish it all. That's nothing next to the masterpiece of design that
you can show off in your custom displays through display templates. Once
the lists have the precise look and feel you envisioned, then living
among the Listies will not only be easy, but fun and exciting.

With the ability to create dynamic sets of data and customize both the
data display as well as the entry, the possible combinations are
limitless. Dynamic Data Lists can be viewed as a way to deliver
small-scale applications that display desired information quickly.
Whether you're building a site like \texttt{list.it} or a real estate
listing service, you'll find the limitless power of dynamic data lists
enticing, easy to use, and above all, empowering.

\chapter{Using Workflow}\label{using-workflow-1}

Liferay Portal includes a workflow engine called Kaleo. In Greek, Kaleo
means ``called ones,'' which is appropriate for a workflow engine that
calls users to participate in a process designed for them. Kaleo
workflow allows a user to define any number of simple to complex
business processes/workflows, deploy them, and manage them through a
portal interface. The processes have knowledge of users, groups and
roles. You don't have to write a single line of code to accomplish this:
all you have to do is create one XML document. And if you're a Liferay
EE customer, you get a graphical workflow designer which gives you a
point and click interface to create workflows.

To explain how to use Kaleo Workflow, this chapter covers:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Enabling workflow
\item
  Creating workflow definitions
\item
  Configuring assets to use workflow process definitions
\item
  Using workflow with other applications
\end{itemize}

Once we're done with this chapter, you should be familiar with how to
use Liferay's Kaleo workflow to set up approval process for any kind of
content before it is published to your portal.

\section{Enabling workflow}\label{enabling-workflow}

Liferay's Kaleo workflow engine can be installed for both CE and EE
versions of Liferay. The web plugin's name is \texttt{kaleo-web} and is
bundled in the \emph{Kaleo Forms EE} and \emph{Kaleo Workflow CE} apps
on Liferay marketplace, wich you can access through the Apps section of
the Control Panel. Installing the plugin adds a \emph{Workflow} option
under the \emph{Configuration} section of your Control Panel.

The \texttt{kaleo-web} plugin comes bundled with one worfklow called the
Single Approver Workflow. This workflow requires one approval before an
asset can be published. One of the conveniences of using Liferay's
workflow engine is that any roles specified in the workflow definition
are created automatically when the definition is deployed. This provides
a level of integration with the portal that third party engines cannot
match. The Single Approver Workflow contains three roles, each with
different scopes. You can deduce the scope of each role by its name:
Site Content Reviewer, Organization Content Reviewer and Portal Content
Reviewer.

Let's jump right in and create a workflow process definition.

\section{Creating new workflow
definitions}\label{creating-new-workflow-definitions}

A Kaleo workflow, called a \emph{process definition}, is defined in an
XML file and is executed by users of the portal. You can create as many
different workflow definitions as needed to manage the work done on your
portal. Your workflows can define new user roles to manage the approval
process or use roles that already exist in your portal.

The XML file has several parts which define the workflow. To get an idea
of how this works, we'll examine the default
\texttt{single-approver-definition.xml} file which is included in the
Liferay Kaleo plugin.

The key parts of the workflow definition are the asset or
workflow-enabled action that's running through the workflow, the nodes
of the workflow, and the transitions between nodes. Assets are any kind
of asset registered in Liferay: web content, wiki articles, message
board threads, blogs entries, and even comments, are workflow-enabled.
Workflow-enabled actions in the portal include Page Revision and User
addition or editing. Developers can also create their own assets to use
with workflows (see \href{http://manning.com/sezov}{\emph{Liferay in
Action}} or \emph{Liferay Developer Network} for more information).
Nodes represent stages of the workflow and there are several types.
Transitions occur between nodes and indicate what the next node should
be.

Think of workflow as a state machine made up of nodes. A node can be a
state, a task, a condition, a fork, a join, or a timer. Transitions are
used to move from one node to another. Each type of node has different
properties. For example, states execute actions automatically and
require no user input. Tasks block until user input completes a
transition to another state. The transition then moves the workflow to
the next task or state. This cycle continues until the end Approved
state is reached. For example, you could create a workflow which goes
through two approvers. Initiating the workflow puts it in the In Review
state and then transitions to a task which requires user input. Users
approve or reject the asset as part of the task. When the first user
approves the asset in the workflow, a condition checks to see if there
are two approvals. Since there is only one, workflow transitions back to
the task. When the second user approves the asset, the condition finds
there are two approvers and it triggers a different transition to the
Approved state.

Let's learn about the Single Approver Workflow's components and look in
detail at how you'd create a workflow using a single approver.

\subsection{Starting a workflow
definition}\label{starting-a-workflow-definition}

Below is a diagram of a single approver workflow definition. It has only
two tasks (Update and Review) and two states (Initial State and
Approved).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/kaleo-workflow-single-approver.png}
\caption{\\Figure 12.1: The default single approver workflow. Arrows
represent transitions and boxes represent states and tasks.}
\end{figure}

First you should define the schema. For Liferay workflows using Kaleo,
\texttt{life\-ray-work\-flow-def\-in\-i\-tion-6\_2\_0.xsd} should be your schema.
You can find this schema in the \texttt{definitions} folder of the
Liferay source or a good XML editor can cache it from Liferay's web
site. Here's how you define it in your workflow definition's XML file:

\begin{verbatim}
<workflow-definition
    xmlns="urn:liferay.com:liferay-workflow_6.2.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="urn:liferay.com:liferay-workflow_6.2.0 
        http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-workflow-definition_6_2_0.xsd"
>
\end{verbatim}

Next you define a name and description for the workflow. This appears in
the control panel when users choose and configure workflows.

\begin{verbatim}
<name>Single Approver</name>
<description>A single approver can approve a workflow content.</description>
<version>1</version>
\end{verbatim}

After that, you define your initial state.

\subsection{Creating an initial state}\label{creating-an-initial-state}

In this case, the state is simply that the asset has been created.
States can contain actions and transitions. Actions can contain scripts.
You can specify the language of the script with the
\texttt{\textless{}script-language\textgreater{}} tag. Scripts can be
written in Groovy, JavaScript, Ruby or Python (see chapter 18 for more
information on leveraging scripts in workflow). For a state, the action
is triggered automatically and then executes a transition. Transitions
move you to a new state or task.

\begin{verbatim}
<state>
    <name>created</name>
    <metadata>
        <![CDATA[{"xy":[36,51]}]]>
    </metadata>
    <initial>true</initial>
\end{verbatim}

From the initial state, you transition to a new task, where further
processing is blocked so the asset can be reviewed.

\begin{verbatim}
    <transitions>
        <transition>
            <name>review</name>
            <target>review</target>
        </transition>
    </transitions>
</state>
\end{verbatim}

The next step is to create a task.

\subsection{Creating tasks}\label{creating-tasks}

The task has several parts and is the most complex part of the
definition. Tasks are linked with roles in order to choose who should
complete the task. Roles are notified that there's new content in need
of review. If you define a role that doesn't exist, it is created
automatically.

The first task listed in the \texttt{single-approver-definition.xml}
workflow definition is the \emph{update} task. Though it appears first
in the file, it's actually not the first task in the workflow. The
\emph{update} task is the task that's assigned by the workflow if the
asset is rejected by an approver. It's listed first because it's the
default task: when this task is triggered, the workflow process is reset
back to the beginning. In this task, the asset is assigned back to the
content creator, who receives an email notification and is required to
resubmit the asset. Once the task is resubmitted, it goes back to the
review stage.

You can also see the task is assigned to
\texttt{\textless{}user/\textgreater{}}. This tag always assigns the
task back to the user who created the asset.

\begin{verbatim}
<task>
    <name>update</name>
    <metadata>
        <![CDATA[{"transitions":{"resubmit":{"bendpoints":[[303,140]]}},"xy":[328,199]}]]>
    </metadata>
    <actions>
        <action>
            <name>reject</name>
            <script>
                <![CDATA[
                    Packages.com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowStatusManagerUtil.
                        updateStatus(
                        Packages.com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowConstants.
                        toStatus("denied"), workflowContext);
                    Packages.com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowStatusManagerUtil.
                        updateStatus(
                        Packages.com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowConstants.
                        toStatus("pending"), workflowContext);
                ]]>
            </script>
            <script-language>javascript</script-language>
            <execution-type>onAssignment</execution-type>
        </action>
        <notification>
            <name>Creator Modification Notification</name>
            <template>
                Your submission was rejected by ${userName}, please modify and resubmit.
            </template>
            <template-language>freemarker</template-language>
            <notification-type>email</notification-type>
            <notification-type>user-notification</notification-type>
            <execution-type>onAssignment</execution-type>
        </notification>
    </actions>
    <assignments>
        <user />
    </assignments>
    <transitions>
        <transition>
            <name>resubmit</name>
            <target>review</target>
        </transition>
    </transitions>
</task>
\end{verbatim}

The \emph{review} task is the first task in the workflow. This is where
portal users with the proper role review the content and decide to
reject it (move it back to the beginning) or accept it (transition it to
the next step).

Once the transition has been made to this task, a notification is sent
to those who are assigned to the task. You can edit the name or content
of the notification in the XML file. Once the reviewer completes their
review and exits the workflow task, another email is sent to the
original submitter indicating that the review is completed.

\begin{verbatim}
<task>
    <name>review</name>
    <metadata>
        <![CDATA[{"xy":[168,36]}]]>
    </metadata>
    <actions>
        <notification>
            <name>Review Notification</name>
            <template>
                ${userName} sent you a ${entryType} for review in the workflow.
            </template>
            <template-language>freemarker</template-language>
            <notification-type>email</notification-type>
            <notification-type>user-notification</notification-type>
            <execution-type>onAssignment</execution-type>
        </notification>
        <notification>
            <name>Review Completion Notification</name>
            <template>
                Your submission has been reviewed and the reviewer has 
                applied the following ${taskComments}.
            </template>
            <template-language>freemarker</template-language>
            <notification-type>email</notification-type>
            <recipients>
                <user />
            </recipients>
            <execution-type>onExit</execution-type>
        </notification>
    </actions>
\end{verbatim}

You must also assign the task to a specific role or roles. This role
doesn't have to be the role you notified. For example, you might want to
notify all the content creators any time a new item is submitted.
Regardless of who you're notifying, you definitely want to send a
notification to anyone who is responsible for approving content.

\subsection{Sending notifications}\label{sending-notifications}

Notifications need an \texttt{execution-type} which can be
\texttt{onAssignment}, \texttt{onEntry} or \texttt{on\-Ex\-it}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{onAssignment} generates and sends the notification when the
  user is assigned the task in the workflow. \textbf{Note:}
  \texttt{onAssignment} notification will not work if you wish to notify
  a user that is not part of the workflow.
\item
  \texttt{onEntry} generates and sends the notification when entering
  the workflow task or state.
\item
  \texttt{onExit} generates and sends the notification when exiting the
  workflow task or state.
\end{itemize}

Notifications also need a \texttt{notification-type} which can be
\texttt{email}, \texttt{im} or \texttt{priv\-ate-mes\-sage}. Note that both
the \texttt{private-message} and \texttt{im} types are placeholders for
now; that functionality is in Liferay's Social Office product but has
not yet been integrated into Liferay Portal. Your notification type and
execution type should complement each other. You wouldn't want to use an
\texttt{onExit} execution type with a private message, because the user
won't receive that message until he or she logs back in. Generally
speaking, email notifications work best with \texttt{onExit} or
\texttt{onAssignment}, while IM or private message work better with
\texttt{onEntry}.

Email and private message notifications can also be created as plain
text or you can create formatted content using FreeMarker or Velocity
templating languages. When creating the notification, you need to
specify the \texttt{template-language} as \texttt{text},
\texttt{freemarker} or \texttt{velocity}.

In this workflow, anyone who is capable of approving the content is
notified \texttt{on\-As\-sign\-ment}. This includes administrators and site
and organization owners. The \texttt{role-\-type} tag helps the system
sort out who should receive the notification based on the scope and can
be set as \emph{site}, \emph{organization} or \emph{portal}. When you
specify a \texttt{role-type} to define the scope of the workflow
notification, please note that the portal role is equvalent to the
\emph{regular} role-type declaration in our XML snippet below.

\begin{verbatim}
<assignments>
    <roles>
        <role>
            <role-type>organization</role-type>
            <name>Organization Administrator</name>
        </role>
        <role>
            <role-type>organization</role-type>
            <name>Organization Content Reviewer</name>
        </role>
        <role>
            <role-type>organization</role-type>
            <name>Organization Owner</name>
        </role>
        <role>
            <role-type>regular</role-type>
            <name>Administrator</name>
        </role>
        <role>
            <role-type>regular</role-type>
            <name>Portal Content Reviewer</name>
        </role>
        <role>
            <role-type>site</role-type>
            <name>Site Administrator</name>
        </role>
        <role>
            <role-type>site</role-type>
            <name>Site Content Reviewer</name>
        </role>
        <role>
            <role-type>site</role-type>
            <name>Site Owner</name>
        </role>
    </roles>
</assignments>
\end{verbatim}

Once the content is approved you'll want to transition to a new state.

\subsection{Using transitions}\label{using-transitions}

In this case, you only need a single approver, then the transition goes
to the final approved state. In more complex workflows, you might
transition to a second tier approver.

\begin{verbatim}
    <transitions>
        <transition>
            <name>approve</name>
            <target>approved</target>
        </transition>
        <transition>
            <name>reject</name>
            <target>update</target>
            <default>false</default>
        </transition>
    </transitions>
</task>
\end{verbatim}

Finally, we define our end state. Remember states automatically run all
actions that are assigned to them, so a script executes and sets the
state of the content to \emph{approved}. Workflow scripts are completely
contained within XML workflow definitions.

You could also write a customized script if there were actions outside
the standard one that you need to perform on your asset. The script
below, written in JavaScript, sets the status of the asset to
\emph{approved}. Of course, there's much more you can do with scripts.
You don't even have to use JavaScript: if you want, you can change the
\texttt{\textless{}script-language\textgreater{}} to another supported
language (Ruby, Groovy or Python) and rewrite the action with additional
details to meet your needs.

\begin{verbatim}
<state>
    <name>approved</name>
    <metadata>
        <![CDATA[
            {"xy":[380,51]}
        ]]>
    </metadata>
    <actions>
        <action>
            <name>approve</name>
            <script>
                <![CDATA[
                    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowStatusManagerUtil;
                    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowConstants;

                    WorkflowStatusManagerUtil.updateStatus(
                        WorkflowConstants.toStatus("approved"), workflowContext);
                ]]>
            </script>
            <script-language>groovy</script-language>
            <execution-type>onEntry</execution-type>
        </action>
    </actions>
</state>
\end{verbatim}

To create longer workflows, you'd create additional states, tasks and
transitions according to your requirements. For instance, if you wanted
to have a second level of review before an item is approved, you'd
create a new task in between the \emph{review} task and the
\emph{approved} state. The task itself might have similar content to
\emph{review} but you would assign it to a different role. The
\emph{review} task would transition to your new task and the new task
would transition to the \emph{approved} state.

You can also use \emph{forks} and \emph{joins} to create more complex
workflows.

\subsection{Using forks and joins}\label{using-forks-and-joins}

Forks and joins are used for parallel processing. For example, say you
have a new offer you'd like to put up on your site but it needs to go
through both the sales manager and the marketing manager first. You can
set up a workflow that notifies both managers at the same time so they
can approve them individually. This way, you're not waiting for one
manager's approval before you can send the notification to the other
manager. The below illustration shows how a workflow with a fork and a
join might be designed.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{../../images/kaleo-workflow-parallel-approval.png}
\caption{\\Figure 12.2: Parallel Approval Design}
\end{figure}

You can transition to a fork from a task or state. From the fork, you
can transition to multiple tasks or states which occur in parallel. In
the previous example, when we have multiple transitions from one task,
they're mutually exclusive: you either trigger one or the other. The
transitions are also serial, meaning one must occur before the next one
can occur. With a parallel workflow, you can have different approvals
going through different users at the same time. For example, you could
use this to separate two different departments' approval chains on a
single asset. A fork should be formatted like this:

\begin{verbatim}
<fork>
    <name>review_fork</name>
    <transitions>
        <transition>
            <name>node_1</name>
            <target>review_one</target>
        </transition>
        <transition>
            <name>node_2</name>
            <target>review_two</target>
        </transition>
    </transitions>
</fork>
\end{verbatim}

To bring a fork back together, transition both nodes of the fork back to
a single join. A join is formatted similarly to a fork, except that any
transitions are serial, not parallel, as in the example below.

\begin{verbatim}
<join>
    <name>approved</name>
    <transitions>
        <transition>
            <name>result</name>
            <target>done</target>
            <default>true</default>
        </transition>
    </transitions>
</join>
\end{verbatim}

Another important consideration when creating parallel approvals is each
node needs its own ``rejected'' state for cases where content is
approved in one node but rejected in another. Another feature you can
use in custom workflows along with forks and joins is Timers. While
using parallel workflow enables you to speed up your process by getting
content in front more people at once, instead of making them wait in
line, timers allow you to add some urgency to the process.

\subsection{Timers}\label{timers}

\emph{Timers} help make sure important tasks in a workflow aren't
forgotten or left undone because of an oversight or the absence of
someone on the critical path. The basic concept of the timer is that
after a period of time specified, a specific action occurs. There are
two main elements for a Timer, the \emph{Task Timer} and the \emph{Timer
Action}.

Timers occur within a Task element and are formatted like:

\begin{verbatim}
<task>
    ...
    <task-timers>
        <task-timer>
            <name></name>
            <delay>
                <duration></duration>
                <scale></scale>
            </delay>
            <timer-actions>
                ...
            </timer-actions>
        </task-timer>
    </task-timers>
    ...
</task>
    
\end{verbatim}

The outer element is \texttt{\textless{}task-timers\textgreater{}}
because you can have multiple timers with multiple actions. The specific
\texttt{\textless{}task-timer\textgreater{}} then contains the element
\texttt{\textless{}delay\textgreater{}} which has a
\texttt{\textless{}duration\textgreater{}} and
\texttt{\textless{}scale\textgreater{}}. The duration can be any number,
whole or fractional, and it's significance is defined by the scale. The
scale tells you what unit of time the duration is talking about -
seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years. Once you've
determined the time, you'll want to pick an action - either a
notification, reassignment or a custom script.

Notifications are pretty simple - if a certain amount of time passes and
an action isn't completed yet, the user assigned to the task will
receive a fresh notification. With the timer, you have all of the
standard notification types available and you can choose a different
notification type than was used for the original notification. For
example, you could create a definition such that when a new item is
submitted to the workflow, all members of the \emph{Content Reviewer}
role receive a notification. You could then use a timer to say if the
content hasn't been reviewed within two hours each member of the
\emph{Content Reviewer} role will receive a second notification via
instant messenger.

A Notification would be formatted like this:

\begin{verbatim}
<timer-actions>
    <timer-notification>
        <name></name>
        <template></template>
        <template-language>text</template-language>
        <notification-type>im</notification-type>
    </timer-notification>
</timer-actions>
\end{verbatim}

Reassignments are designed to keep the workflow moving, even if a key
person is out of the office. With a timer set to reassign, after the
specified amount of time has passed, the task can be assigned to a new
role. Building off of our example above, if the Content Reviewers all
received the IM notification after two hours, but the content still
wasn't approved after four hours, the workflow could be set to
automatically reassign to the task to the \emph{Administrator} role.

A Reassignment would be formatted like this:

\begin{verbatim}
<timer-actions>
    <reassignments>
        <assignments>
            <roles>
                <role>
                    <role-type></role-type>
                    <name></name>
                </role>
                ...
            </roles>
        </assignments>
    </reassignments>
</timer-actions>
\end{verbatim}

Obviously we can't think of everything, so if you have an idea for using
timers in your workflow that doesn't fit into our design, you could
access Liferay's scripting engine to create a custom action to happen
after a specified amount of time. For example, if you had means of
sending electric shocks through employees chairs if they weren't doing
their work, and had created a Liferay portlet to access the shock
mechanism, you could use a custom script to zap any users who were at
their desk that hadn't reviewed content assigned to them.

\begin{verbatim}
<timer-actions>
    <action>
            <name></name>
            <script>
                <![CDATA[
                ]]>
            </script>
            <script-language></script-language>
            <execution-type></execution-type>
    </action>
</timer-actions>
\end{verbatim}

For more information on using scripting in Liferay, please refer to
chapter 18.

Using workflows and approvals is necessary for virtually any
organization and timers are an excellent way to help mitigate the
potential headaches caused by having multiple bottlenecks through the
process. Using timers in conjunction with other workflow features can
help you create powerful workflows for your organization.

\subsection{Putting it all together}\label{putting-it-all-together}

The Kaleo workflow engine is deeply integrated with Liferay Portal. It
can generate roles scoped for organizations, sites and for the whole
portal based on workflow definitions. You can also customize workflow
options for individual sites.

Users are the most important part of the workflow, since they're the
ones who do all the work. To make a user a part of the workflow process,
you assign them a role which you defined in your workflow. When you're
creating your workflow definition, you can create new roles by defining
them in the XML file or by using roles which you have already created in
your portal. Roles created automatically are always portal scoped, so if
you want to use site or organization scoped roles, create the roles
before deploying your workflow to the portal.

A portal administrator can create a default workflow definition scheme
for each application which applies for the entire portal; site and
organization administrators can customize the settings for their sites
and organizations. Now that we've seen how to create workflow
definitions, let's discuss how to use them.

\section{Configuring assets to use workflow process
definitions}\label{configuring-assets-to-use-workflow-process-definitions}

All your global workflow configuration can be done via the control
panel. Everything you need to do in the portal can be done through
simple GUI controls.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/11-workflow-upload-definition.png}
\caption{\\Figure 12.3: Adding a Workflow Definition}
\end{figure}

You can find the Workflow section under the Configuration heading in the
control panel. There are three tabs under Workflow which are used to
configure workflow in the portal: \emph{Definitions}, \emph{Default
Configuration} and \emph{Submissions}. These tabs let you upload
definitions, enable workflow for your portal's resources, and The
default workflow behavior you specify here will apply throughout your
Liferay Portal.

From the \emph{Definitions} tab you can see the currently available
workflow definitions and add newly created workflow definitions you'd
like to use in the portal. Clicking \emph{Upload Definition} allows you
to enter a title for a new workflow definition, browse to your local XML
file, and upload it to your Liferay instance. Once you add a file here,
it's added to the portal and is immediately available for use.

Under \emph{Default Configuration}, you can set the workflow behavior
for all workflow-enabled actions in the portal; available resources
include Page Revision, User, Blogs Entries, Web Content Articles,
Comments, Message Boards Messages, and Wiki Pages. You can also add a
custom potlet to this list by using Liferay's API. You can choose from
two default workflow options in Default Configuration: \emph{No
Workflow} or \emph{Single Approver}, which we looked at in detail
earlier in the chapter.

When you set the default workflow configuration of a resource, any new
action on that resource defaults to that configuration, throughout the
portal. An administrator can edit the workflow behavior for each site's
resources individually through the \emph{Workflow Configuration} section
of a particular site's Site Administration section. The interface for
making changes at the site level is similar to that of the Control Panel
interface; the only difference is that you are in the Site
Administration section and the changes you specify are only applicable
to the scope you have selected here.

In the \emph{Submissions} tab you can see any currently pending assets
or any assets which were previously approved.

Let's learn more about configuring workflows for both the portal and
individual sites next.

\subsection{Configuring workflow}\label{configuring-workflow}

After you have uploaded workflow definitions and set the default
workflow behavior you can go up to \emph{Default Configuration} and
enable workflow for specified actions in your portal.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/11-workflow-default-config.png}
\caption{\\Figure 12.4: The Workflow Configuration Page}
\end{figure}

By setting default workflow configuration behavior from the Control
Panel, your specified settings are implemented at the global portal
scope. If you need to set the workflow configuration for a specific
site, you can do so from the \emph{Site Administration} section. You can
get there from the Control Panel by clicking \emph{Sites}, clicking on a
site from the list, and opening the \emph{Configuration} menu. The
\emph{Workflow Configuration} option lets you modify workflow behavior
for the sleected site's resources that can be workflow enabled.

\subsection{My Workflow Tasks}\label{my-workflow-tasks}

My Workflow Tasks is a personalized version of the Workflow Tasks and
it's found in the user's My Account section. Here you'll find specific
tasks which were assigned to you or assigned to a role of which you are
a member. You can also view your completed tasks by opening the
Completed tab.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/11-my-workflow-tasks.png}
\caption{\\Figure 12.5: My Workflow Tasks Page}
\end{figure}

Workflow administrative users review and approve content from their My
Worfklow Tasks section. By clicking the link to the asset, you can view
it, and the Actions dropdown lets you approve, reject, or reassign
assets assigned to you. For assets assigned to your roles, you can
assign the listed assets to be reviewed by yourself or another user.
Whether or not an asset is assigned to you or to your role, you can
update the due date as well.

\subsection{My Submissions}\label{my-submissions}

My Submissions is found in your user's My Account section of the portal.
From this screen you can view any assets you have submitted for review.
Those currently under review are listed under the \emph{Pending} tab and
those that have been reviewed are listed under the \emph{Completed} tab.

Besides viewing your work, you can also withdraw a submission from the
review process by clicking on \emph{Withdraw Submission} from the
\emph{Pending} tab.

\subsection{Using Kaleo Workflow Processes in Liferay
Portal}\label{using-kaleo-workflow-processes-in-liferay-portal}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/11-workflow-my-submissions.png}
\caption{\\Figure 12.6: The My Submissions Page}
\end{figure}

Before workflow can be used, you must define which types of assets on
the portal are workflow-enabled. If you have created additional
definitions, you must also choose the workflow definition to use for
each asset that is workflow-enabled.

To demonstrate how this works, we'll create a press release. Press
releases should be posted in the \emph{Newsroom} section of the web
site, so before setting specific workflow configuration options or
creating content, create the Newsroom site. When you click Save, you'll
be redirected to the Site Administration section of the portal where you
can work on the Newsroom site further. Under Configration, in Workflow
Configuration, set Web Content to use the Single Approver workflow.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/11-workflow-site-configuration.png}
\caption{\\Figure 12.7: You can select which site to work on by using the
drop-down menu in the Site Administration section of the portal.}
\end{figure}

Next, create two users, a Content Creator and a Content Reviewer. The
Content Creator logs in and creates a new press release for the Lunar
Resort and clicks \emph{Submit for Publication}. This triggers the
workflow process and notifies the Content Reviewer. When the Content
Reviewer logs in, he or she can assign the workflow task to him- or
herself and approve the content.

Once the content is approved, it can be posted on the Press Releases
page in a Web Content Display portlet.

There's more. EE customers get extra features that enable them to create
workflows without having to deal with XML.

\section{Using workflow with other
applications}\label{using-workflow-with-other-applications}

Above we saw an example of using workflow with Liferay web content. The
process is the same for all resources that are workflow-enabled.
However, while configuring your resources to use workflow in the Default
Configuration tab of the Workflow section, you may have noticed a note
that ``The workflows for the following resources can be configured
within their respective portlets''. resources listed are
\emph{Documents} and \emph{Dynamic Data Lists Records}. Workflow
configuration is more specifically enabled for Documents and Media
folders and Dynamic Data Lists (i.e., each individaul list).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/11-workflow-assign-to-me.png}
\caption{\\Figure 12.8: Before a Content Reviewer can approve content, he
must assign it to himself or have an administrator assign it to him.}
\end{figure}

To see how this works for a Documents and Media folder, create a new
page in the default site called \emph{Documents and Media} and add the
Documents and Media portlet to this page. Then click \emph{Add} $\rightarrow$
\emph{Folder}, enter the name \emph{My Documents}, and click
\emph{Save}. Mouse over your new My Documents folder, click on the black
arrow that appears at the top right corner of the folder, and select
\emph{Edit}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/11-workflow-edit-folder.png}
\caption{\\Figure 12.9: Workflow for Documents and Media must be enabled
at the folder level. Edit a folder to select a workflow.}
\end{figure}

By default, the \emph{Use document type restrictions and workflow of the
parent folder} button is selected. To enable workflow for this folder,
select the \emph{Define specific document type restrictions and workflow
for this folder} button. After you've selected this button, a
\emph{Default Workflow for all Document Types} drop-down menu appears.
By default, you can select \emph{No workflow} or \emph{Single Approver}.
Any custom workflows that you added also appear in this drop-down menu.
You can add custom workflows through the Workflow page in the Portal
section of the Control Panel.

After you've selected the \emph{Single Approver} workflow and clicked
\emph{Save}, workflow takes effect for the My Documents folder. Try
adding a new document to your My Documents folder--notice that the
\emph{Publish} button now says \emph{Submit for Publication} since
workflow is enabled. Any users assigned to the (Portal, Organization, or
Site) Content Reviewer roles can see that your document has been
submitted for publication by navigating to My Account and clicking on
\emph{My Workflow Tasks}. Ordinarily, the same user who submitted a
document for publication wouldn't also approve it but we'll do this to
demonstrate how the process works.

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/11-folder-workflow.png}
\caption{\\Figure 12.10: You can use the document type restrictions and
workflow of the parent folder or you can define specific document type
restrictions and workflow for this folder.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Like with Documents and Media folders, workflow is configured for a
Dynamic Data List at the list level. That is, when you add a New List
for users, you can enable workflow for that particular list. No Workflow
is the default setting, but you can select the Single Approver
definition or any definition you uploaded to use in the portal. When a
user submits an item to a list that was configured to use a workflow,
they'll see the item's status as Pending. Once the list item has been
approved by an administrative user, the status changes to Approved.

Navigate to the My Account and click on \emph{My Workflow Tasks}.
Documents and Data Lists that you submitted for publication appear under
\emph{Assigned to My Roles} since you're an administrator. Click
\emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Assign to Me} next to your document. Then click
\emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Approve} next to the document or list when it
appears in the \emph{Assigned to Me} category. That's it--your resources
have passed through the workflow!

\section{Summary}\label{summary-12}

In this chapter, we explained how to install the Kaleo workflow plugin
for Liferay EE. Liferay's Kaleo workflow engine is included with Liferay
CE. We discussed how to create new workflow definitions and examined the
XML schema for them. We looked at how to choose different workflow
processes for different asset types. We also explained how end-users can
interact with the approval process. Finally, we discussed how to use
workflow with different types of applications such as Documents and
Media and Dynamic Data Lists. In the next chapter, we'll look at Kaleo
forms and the Kaleo workflow designer.

\chapter{Kaleo Forms: Defining Business
Processes}\label{kaleo-forms-defining-business-processes}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.25\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/ee-feature-web.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

In the last chapter, you saw the elements that comprise a workflow
definition and learned how to create a workflow definition. In this
chapter, you'll learn about the Kaleo Forms Admin application for
Liferay EE. This application lets you create workflow definitions using
an intuitive UI. Using the workflow designer saves you the time and
trouble of having to deal directly with the XML.

Developers who are used to working with XML can create workflow
definitions with little struggle. Other users may not be so comfortable
with it. In fact, even skilled developers can make mistakes that break a
definition and require time to troubleshoot. To help streamline the
creation of workflow definitions and empower more users to create custom
workflows, Liferay provides the Kaleo Forms Admin application in Liferay
6.2 EE.

There are two pieces to the workflow designer: \emph{Kaleo Forms Admin}
and \emph{Kaleo Forms Display}. These two portlets are included in the
Kaleo Forms app and can be downloaded from Liferay Marketplace. Kaleo
Forms Admin contains a wizard that guides you through each step in the
creation of a workflow process. This includes a drag and drop interface
for creating new workflow definitions without having to write XML. Kaleo
Forms Display allows you to work with a process in its associated
workflow. In other words, Kaleo Forms Admin is for \emph{creating}
workflow processes, while Kaleo Forms Display is for \emph{using} them.

Let's look at Kaleo Forms Admin first.

\section{Kaleo Forms Admin}\label{kaleo-forms-admin}

You can access Kaleo Forms Admin from the Dockbar by clicking
\emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Content} and then
clicking \emph{Kaleo Forms Admin}. The portlet then appears with a
listing of the processes that you've defined. If you're coming here for
the first time, however, there won't be any, so create one. Click
\emph{Add}. You'll see the screen below. This is the first step in the
\emph{New Process Wizard}. For this example, give your process the name
\emph{Lunar Resort News Content}, add a description, and then click
\emph{Next}.

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/kaleo-forms-admin-wizard-1.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.1: The first step of the New Process Wizard.}
\end{wrapfigure}

The second step in the New Process Wizard lets you define the fields
that can appear in your forms. To the right of the To Do field, click
the \emph{Actions} button and select \emph{Choose}. Now that you've
chosen a field definition for your forms, you can move on to the next
step in the wizard to add or define a workflow for those forms. Click
\emph{Next}.

The third step in the New Process Wizard is really where the meat and
potatoes of Kaleo Forms Admin is. This is where you choose or define a
workflow to use for your forms. The Single Approver workflow is included
by default. To get a look at how it's defined, click \emph{Actions} and
then \emph{Edit}. The graphical interface for editing or defining a
workflow appears below the Details section of the Single Approver edit
screen.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/kaleo-forms-admin-wizard-2.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.2: The second step of the New Process Wizard. This is
where you define and choose the fields for your forms.}
\end{figure}

This graphical view is where Kaleo Forms Admin can help you build a
workflow without having to write any XML. There are eight types of nodes
you can add to a definition. The node types are \textbf{Condition},
\textbf{End}, \textbf{Fork}, \textbf{Join}, \textbf{Join XOR},
\textbf{Start}, \textbf{State} and \textbf{Task}. Notice that Start and
End aren't node types we've previously discussed; that's because they're
actually just State nodes, with certain fields pre-filled to help
streamline the creation process. Since every workflow has a start and
end state, you'd have to do this anyway.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/kaleo-forms-graphical-editor.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.3: The graphical view for editing or defining a
workflow.}
\end{figure}

Each node you add has a pop-up menu letting you edit or delete the node.
As you hover your mouse over the edges of a node, notice your mouse
pointer changes to a cross. The cross indicates you can connect the
current node to another node. Hold down your mouse button and drag the
mouse to start drawing your transition to another node. If you stop
before reaching the edge of the next node, a pop-up displays node types
you can create and connect to on-the-fly. To connect with an existing
node, continue dragging the connector to that node.

To get a feel for how the designer works, go ahead and use the workflow
designer to duplicate the default workflow definition. Go back to the
previous step and click \emph{Add Workflow}. When you choose this
option, it creates a blank workflow definition with start and end nodes.
To make this work, you'll add two tasks, fill in the relevant
information, assign the tasks properly, and create the transitions.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/kaleo-connector.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.4: Create transitions to existing or new nodes. The
connector pop-up let's you create and connect to new nodes on-the-fly.}
\end{figure}

First add two tasks, then use the edit icon to name them \emph{Review}
and \emph{Update}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/kaleo-rename-node.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.5: Edit a node by clicking on its node icon and
modifying its settings.}
\end{figure}

Next, connect the nodes so Review has four nodes, as follows: one
receiving the transition from \textbf{StartNode}, one sending a
transition to \textbf{Update}, one receiving a transition from
\textbf{Update}, and one sending a transition to \textbf{EndNode}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/kaleo-designer-basic-workflow.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.6: Your workflow should look something like this.}
\end{figure}

Next, you want to add the correct assignments and notifications. Click
on \emph{Review}. The box on the left shows all the properties of the
Review node. In the \emph{Assignments} category, set the
\emph{Assignment Type} to \emph{Role Type}, the \emph{Role Type} to
\emph{Regular}, and the \emph{Role Name} to \emph{Portal Content
Reviewer}

Now set the notifications. Double-click on \emph{Notifications} and
create a notification with the Notification Type set to \emph{User
Notification} and the Execution Type set to \emph{On Assignment}.

Together, the assignment and notification settings specify that a user
receives a notification in their Dockbar when assigned a form in this
workflow. Now move to the Update node and assign it to the \emph{Content
Creator} role with its own user notification.

Next, go through all the transitions and make sure they're named
correctly. What are the transitions? Workflow transitions connect one
node to another. On exiting the first node, processing continues to the
node pointed to by the transition. Every time you created an arrow from
one node to another, Kaleo Designer created a transition. By default,
these transitions get system generated names, so we'll rename them all
to something more human-readable. First, click on the arrow going from
the Start node to the Review node and set the name to \emph{Submit} and
set \emph{Default} to true--you'll leave all the others as false. Set
the name of the Review to Update transition to \emph{Reject} and the
Update to Review transition to \emph{Resubmit}. Lastly, set the name of
the Review to Endnode transition to \emph{Approve}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/kaleo-designer-basic-workflow-complete.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.7: Your completed workflow should look like this.}
\end{figure}

Now look at the generated XML. It should look a lot like the default
workflow, only a tiny bit messier, as the nodes are written in the order
they were created, not in the logical order that happens when a human
writes the code. Once you're finished, click \emph{Publish}. Your
workflow is now ready to use!

Back on the third step of the New Process wizard, click \emph{Actions} →
\emph{Choose} next to the workflow you just created. Then click
\emph{Next}.

The fourth and final step of the New Process wizard is for creating or
assigning a form to each task you've defined in the workflow. Each task
appears in a row with its form (if it has been assigned one) and a
button that lets you assign a form. Therefore, you have \emph{create},
\emph{update}, and \emph{review} listed as your tasks.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/kaleo-forms-admin-wizard-4.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.8: The fourth step in the New Process wizard lets
you assign a form to each task.}
\end{figure}

Go ahead and click on the \emph{Assign Form} button next to the created
task. On the next page, click the \emph{Add Form} button. The screen
that appears lets you create a new form. First, give the form the name
\emph{Initial Form}, since it's the first form in the process. Next,
take a look at the available fields. This is a simple review task so you
won't need all the fields that are in the form by default. To delete a
field, mouse over it and click the \emph{Trash} icon that appears. Go
ahead and delete all but the \emph{Assigned To}, \emph{Severity},
\emph{Start Date}, \emph{Status}, and \emph{Title} fields. Your form
should now look like the one in the screenshot here.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/kaleo-forms-admin-form-creation-1.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.9: Basic form creation.}
\end{figure}

If you delete a field by accident or simply want to add another field to
your form, you can do so by dragging and dropping its icon from the
\emph{Fields} tab on the left to the form itself on the right. Fields
already on the form that can appear on it only once are grayed out. You
can also edit the settings of a field in the form by mousing over it and
clicking the wrench icon. For example, the settings for the Assigned To
field are shown in this screenshot.

Since you don't need to change any of the field settings in this form,
go ahead and click \emph{Save}. On the next screen, choose your new form
from the \emph{Actions} button next to it. Now that you're familiar with
the basics of form creation and assignment, create a form titled
\emph{Second Form} to use for the update and review tasks. Give it the
following fields:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Assigned To
\item
  Attachment
\item
  Comments
\item
  Description
\item
  End Date
\item
  \% Complete
\item
  Severity
\item
  Start Date
\item
  Status
\item
  Title
\end{itemize}

Make sure you choose the new form for your update and review tasks. When
you're done assigning forms to tasks, click \emph{Save}. Your new
process is complete, and is listed in the Kaleo Forms Admin portlet.
Congratulations!

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1in]{../../images/kaleo-forms-admin-process-complete.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.10: Once created, your process is listed in Kaleo
Forms Admin.}
\end{figure}

Now it's time to look at how to use workflow processes in the Kaleo
Forms Display portlet.

\section{Kaleo Forms Display}\label{kaleo-forms-display}

The Kaleo Forms Display portlet makes use of the workflow processes that
you create in the Kaleo Forms Admin portlet. Add the Kaleo Forms Display
portlet to a page if you haven't done so yet. Any forms available for
processing through the workflow can be initiated through the
\emph{Submit New} button, as the below image indicates.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1in]{../../images/kaleo-forms-display.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.11: The Kaleo Forms Display portlet.}
\end{figure}

To initiate a process in the workflow, click \emph{Submit New} →
\emph{Lunar Resort News Content}. The portlet now displays the form you
assigned to the first task in your workflow. Fill out the form and click
\emph{Save}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/kaleo-forms-display-submit-new.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.12: Submitting a new process.}
\end{figure}

The workflow now automatically guides the form on to the next step. For
example, if you submit a new process using the Single Approver process
created in the section above, it is assigned automatically to the Portal
Content Reviewer role. If you are a Portal Content Reviewer, the task
then appears in the \emph{Assigned to My Roles} section of the Kaleo
Forms Display portlet, and you receive a notification in your Dockbar.
You can then assign it to yourself using the portlet and complete the
task.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1in]{../../images/kaleo-forms-display-assigned-role.png}
\caption{\\Figure 13.13: The workflow automatically assigns the task to a
specific role.}
\end{figure}

\section{Summary}\label{summary-13}

As you can see, Liferay Portal and the Kaleo Workflow engine combine to
create a robust environment for web content management. The Kaleo Forms
portlets allow you to manage all available workflows in the portal. You
can create your portal's workflows by using Kaleo Forms Admin's drag and
drop interface. Simple workflows can be managed using the default
configuration and GUI tools, while more complex workflows can be created
to meet the workflow management needs of almost any portal. Through this
chapter and the previous one, you've taken a look at the various
elements of a workflow and been shown how to use those elements to
create your own custom workflows. You've also seen how properly to use
the various elements of a workflow like Assignments and Notifications,
as well as newer and more advanced features like Parallel Workflows,
Timers, and Custom Scripts.

It's not enough to understand each individual step of the workflow
process: one of the keys to using Kaleo workflow is to understand how
each step interacts with the other elements. If you understand these
relationships, you can figure out which features will work best for your
organization. We hope you'll use the information we've covered on
workflows to craft suitable processes for your portal.

\chapter{Liferay Utility
Applications}\label{liferay-utility-applications}

In this chapter we'll look at some Liferay utility applications that
might be useful for you. The Software Catalog has been replaced by
Liferay Marketplace but can still be installed as a plugin. Please see
chapter 13 for information about Liferay Marketplace and managing
Liferay plugins. The Reports, JasperReports, and Knowledge Base
applications are only available to EE customers. In this chapter we'll
discuss following applications:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Bookmarks
\item
  Software Catalog
\item
  Shopping
\item
  Reports and JasperReports
\item
  Knowledge Base
\item
  Akismet
\item
  Weather
\item
  OAuth
\end{itemize}

Liferay's Bookmarks application is a simple way for users to keep track
of URLs in the portal that can also be used by an administrator to
publish relevant links to groups of users. The Software Catalog allows
you to define a set of software items to display to visitors. The
Knowledge Base application allows you to create articles and organize
them into full books or guides that be published on your portal.

\section{Capturing Web Sites with the Bookmarks
Portlet}\label{capturing-web-sites-with-the-bookmarks-portlet}

Many of us enjoy collecting things we value. They may be stamps, comic
books, sea shells, or fabulous shoes. The list goes on and on. But have
you considered URLs collectible? Having a thorough collection of links
can be a great way to add value to your portal's usability.

With Liferay's Bookmarks application, users collect and manage URLs in
the portal. They can add, edit, delete, export and import bookmarks.
Users can use links to access regularly visited web sites.
Administrators can publish links tailored to specific groups of users.
Both internal pages as well as external sites can be bookmarked.

\subsection{Adding and Using
Bookmarks}\label{adding-and-using-bookmarks}

Navigate to your portal and add the Bookmarks application to your page
by selecting \emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Applications}. The portlet looks like
this by default:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/bookmarks-add-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.1: Initially, no bookmarks are listed in this form
until they're created.}
\end{figure}

Across the top of the portlet are links labeled Home, Recent, and Mine.
There is also a Search field and button.

\textbf{Home:} returns you to the top level of the portlet.

\textbf{Recent:} displays a list of the latest bookmarks that have been
added.

\textbf{Mine:} displays a list of the bookmarks you added to the
portlet.

\textbf{Search:} lets you search for bookmarks by name, category, or
tags.

When you select the \emph{Permissions} button on the right, a list of
Roles and their associated permissions appears. The options are Add
Entry, Add Folder, Permissions, and View. When you are finished
selecting the permissions, click \emph{Save}.

Clicking the \emph{Add Folder} button in the Bookmarks application
reveals the \emph{New Folder} form. Here you can choose the folder's
name, a description of its contents, and who can view it. Under More
Options, you can set portlet permissions for various Roles to the
folder. Click \emph{Save} when you are finished.

To create a bookmark, click the \emph{Add Bookmark} button. This form is
similar to the New Folder form but has a few more options.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/bookmarks-add-new-form.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.2: When you use the Add Bookmark form, you must enter
a valid URL in the required field.}
\end{figure}

Click \emph{Select} to choose the folder for the new bookmark. Click
\emph{Remove} to delete a bookmark from the selected folder. As stated
above, a removed link goes into the list of general bookmarks that
aren't associated with a folder. These are listed in the bookmarks
section, below the folders, in the portlet.

Below the Permissions there are additional options for Categorization
and Related Assets, just like in other Liferay applications. Please see
chapter 6 on the Asset Framework for further information about this.

Once you have added a new bookmark, it appears in the portlet. From
here, you can manage your bookmark using familiar Liferay editing
features. Collecting and organizing your links is a snap when you use
Liferay's Bookmarks application.

\subsection{Organizing Bookmarks by
Folder}\label{organizing-bookmarks-by-folder}

You can store all your important links in one place and you can manage
this data easily using folders. You can create, edit, and delete
bookmark folders. You get to decide how many bookmarks or folders are
displayed on a page. Bookmark folders can have any number of subfolders.

Here's an example of what one bookmarks portlet might look like.
Bookmark Folders are displayed above individual bookmarks.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/bookmarks-folder-view-wide.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.3: Individual bookmarks, not associated with a
folder, are listed separately.}
\end{figure}

In this example, there are six bookmark folders, three of which have
subfolders. The columns showing the number of folders and the number of
entries show the subfolders and the entries contained within each top
level folder. Note that total number of bookmarks includes those in the
subfolders.

Using the Actions button on the right, you can edit the folder, manage
folder permissions, delete the folder, add a subfolder, or add a
bookmark to the folder.

As your collection of links grows, you may need to add more subfolders
to keep things in order. Should you decide a link needs to move from one
folder to another, you can manage this using the Edit option for that
link.

\subsubsection{Moving a Link}\label{moving-a-link}

Just for fun, let's move a link from the main bookmarks folder into a
subfolder one level down. We'll move the Liferay link into the Trivia
subfolder in the Sports \& Games folder. The Trivia subfolder is a child
of the Sports \& Games folder. We'll move the link to the Sports \&
Games folder first before moving it into the Trivia subfolder.

To achieve this, we select \emph{Edit} from the Actions button for the
link. In the Edit view, find the section called \emph{Folder}. When
applicable, this section contains breadcrumb links to allow you to
navigate freely among the other folder levels. Currently, there are two
buttons here labeled Select and Remove. Click the \emph{Select} button
and a new window appears, like the one below. Clicking the \emph{Remove}
button here doesn't affect the link. It is used solely for moving links
out of folders and subfolders back into the main Bookmarks view.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/bookmarks-choosing-subfolder.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.4: Select the Choose button next to the desired
folder.}
\end{figure}

Now choose the \emph{Sports \& Games} folder. When you do this, notice
how the link's Folder section changes to reflect the new location of the
link. When you choose \emph{Save}, you return to the Bookmarks portlet.
Notice that the Liferay link is no longer under the Bookmarks section.
Select \emph{Sports \& Games} to reveal its contents. In the example
below, you can see the Liferay link is now in the bookmarks section of
the Sports \& Games folder.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/bookmarks-link-move.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.5: When you move a link to a folder, it remains in
the bookmarks section until it's moved into a subfolder.}
\end{figure}

Select \emph{Edit} from the Actions button next to the Liferay link,
then click \emph{Select}. Navigate to the \emph{\# of Folders} number
next to the Sports \& Games folder and choose the \emph{Trivia}
subfolder. Again, notice the change in the folder-level breadcrumbs.
Click \emph{Save} and the Sports \& Games folder view appears. change in
the link's folder section, which now displays \emph{Trivia}. Click
\emph{Save} and the Sports \& Games folder view appears. Select
\emph{Trivia} to see your link in the subfolder's bookmarks list. Piece
of cake, right?

To move a link out of a subfolder and into a higher-level folder, edit
the link in the subfolder and choose \emph{Select}. In the resulting
window, select the appropriate folder from the breadcrumbs at the top.
In this example, we selected \emph{Sports \& Games} for consistency.
This opens a new window, like the one below, showing the other folder
options.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../../images/bookmarks-link-move3.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.6: In this view, you can move the link into several
different locations.}
\end{figure}

You can choose one of the other subfolders from the list, or you can
choose \emph{Home} from the breadcrumbs at the top. When you verify that
the desired folder is the one currently displayed in the breadcrumbs,
click \emph{Choose This Folder}. Then click \emph{Save} and you're done.
If you don't like any of the subfolders listed, you can place the link
into a new subfolder by using the \emph{Add Subfolder} button.

If you choose \emph{Remove} instead of Select in the above example, you
take the link out of both subfolders and return it to the main bookmarks
view.

Now that you have an understanding of how bookmark folders are used,
let's create our own plugin repository.

\section{Creating Your Own Plugin
Repository}\label{creating-your-own-plugin-repository}

As your enterprise builds its own library of portlets for internal use,
you can create your own plugin repository to make it easy to install and
upgrade portlets. This will allow different departments who may be
running different instances of Liferay to share portlets and install
them as needed. If you are a software development house, you may wish to
create a plugin repository for your own products. Liferay makes it easy
for you to create your own plugin repository and make it available to
others.

You can create your plugin repository in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Use the Software Catalog in the Control Panel to create the repository
  by using its graphical interface and an HTTP server.
\item
  Create an XML file using the Liferay Plugin Repository DTD
  \footnote{\url{http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-plugin-repository\_6\_2\_0.dtd}}
  and an HTTP server.
\end{enumerate}

Both methods have their benefits. The first method allows users to
upload their plugins to an HTTP server to which they have access. They
can then register their plugins with the repository by adding a link to
it via the Control Panel's graphical user interface. Liferay will then
generate the XML necessary to connect the repository to a Control Panel
running on another instance of Liferay. This XML file can then be placed
on an HTTP server and its URL can be added to the Plugin Installer,
making the portlets in this repository available to the server running
Liferay.

The second method does not require an instance of Liferay to be running.
You can upload plugins to an HTTP server of your choice, then create an
XML file called \texttt{life\-ray-plug\-in-re\-pos\-i\-tor\-y.xml} manually. If you
make this file available on an HTTP server (it can be the same one which
is storing the plugins or a different one), you can connect the
repository to a Plugin Installer in the Control Panel running on an
instance of Liferay.

We will first look at creating a plugin repository using the Software
Catalog in the Control Panel.

\subsection{Software Catalog}\label{software-catalog}

You will want to use the Software Catalog if you will have multiple
users submitting portlets into the repository and if you don't want to
worry about creating the \texttt{life\-ray-plug\-in-re\-pos\-i\-tor\-y.xml} file
yourself.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} The Software Catalog plugin was deprecated in Liferay 6.2
and is disabled by default. To activate it, navigate to the Control
Panel $\rightarrow$\emph{Plugins Configuration} and scroll through the list of
portlets until you find \emph{Software Catalog}. Select \emph{Software
Catalog} and click the \emph{Active} checkbox. Then click \emph{Save}.

\end{roundedframe}
You can add the Software Catalog portlet to your page by navigating to
\emph{Add} $\rightarrow$ \emph{Applications} and selecting it from the \emph{Tools}
category.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../../images/marketplace-software-catalog.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.7: The Software Catalog portlet can be added to any
of your site pages.}
\end{figure}

Each site in your portal can have an instance of the Software Catalog.
The Software Catalog can be managed from your site's Site Administration
page. This means different sites can have different software
repositories, so you can host several software repositories on the same
instance of Liferay if you wish, they just have to be in different
sites. Choose the site that will host the plugin repository and go to
the Site Administration page. You can change the site that you're on by
navigating to the Dockbar's \emph{My Sites} drop-down menu and selecting
your desired site.

The Software Catalog has several tabs. The first tab is labeled
Products. The default view of the portlet, when populated with software,
displays what plugins are available for install or download. This can be
seen in the version on Liferay's home page.

We will use an example site in order to better illustrate how to use the
Software Catalog portlet. Assume you, as the portal administrator, have
created a site called \emph{Old Computers}. This site will be for users
to collaborate on setting up and using old computers with obsolete
hardware and operating systems. Users who participate in the site will
eventually get upgraded to a more privileged status and get their own
blog page. To implement this, you have created a My Summary portlet
which displays the user's name, picture, and description from his or her
user profile. Because this portlet is generic enough that it could be
useful to anyone using Liferay, you have decided to make it available in
your own software catalog.

The first step in adding a plugin to your software repository is to add
a license for your product. A license communicates to users the terms
upon which you are allowing them to download and use your software.
Click the \emph{Licenses} tab and then click the \emph{Add License}
button that appears. You will then see a form which allows you to enter
the title of your license, a URL pointing to the actual license document
and check boxes denoting whether the license is open source, active or
recommended.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/marketplace-populated-software-catalog.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.8: This is an example of a populated Software Catalog
from liferay.com}
\end{figure}

When you have finished filling out the form, click the \emph{Save}
button. Your license will be saved. Once you have at least one license
in the system, you can begin adding software products to your software
catalog. Click the \emph{Products} tab, then click the \emph{Add
Product} button.

Your next step will be to create the product record in the software
catalog. This will register the product in the software catalog and
allow you to start adding versions of your software for users to
download and/or install directly from their instances of Liferay. You
will first need to put the \texttt{.war} file containing your software
on a web server that is accessible without authentication to the users
who will be installing your software. In the example above, the
\emph{Old Computers} site is on the Internet so you would place the file
on a web server that is accessible to anyone on the Internet. If you are
creating a software catalog for an internal Intranet, you would place
the file on a web server that is available to anyone inside of your
organization's firewall.

To create the product record in the Software Catalog portlet, click the
\emph{Products} tab, then click the \emph{Add Product} button. Fill out
the form with information about your product.

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/marketplace-adding-product-to-software-catalog.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.9: The \emph{New Product} screen provides a
recommended licenses setting for your product.}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Name:} The name of your software product.

\textbf{Type:} Select whether this is a portlet, theme, layout template,
hook or web plugin.

\textbf{Licenses:} Select the license(s) under which you are releasing
this software. You must first add a license using the \emph{License} tab
before you can select it in the \emph{New Product} form.

\textbf{Author:} Enter the name of the author of the software.

\textbf{Page URL:} If the software has a home page, enter its URL here.

\textbf{Tags:} Enter any tags you would like added to this software.

\textbf{Short Description:} Enter a short description. This will be
displayed in the summary table of your software catalog.

\textbf{Long Description:} Enter a longer description. This will be
displayed on the details page for this software product.

\textbf{Permissions:} Click the \emph{Configure} link to set permissions
for this software product.

\textbf{Site ID:} Enter a site ID. A site ID is a name space which
identifies the site that released the software. For our example, we will
use \emph{old-computers}.

\textbf{Artifact ID:} Enter an Artifact ID. The artifact ID is a unique
name within the name space for your product. For our example, we will
use \emph{my-summary-portlet}.

\textbf{Screenshot:} Click the \emph{Add Screenshot} button to add a
screen shot of your product for users to view.

When you have finished filling out the form, click the \emph{Save}
button. You will be brought back to the product summary page and you
will see your product has been added to the repository.

Notice in the version column, \emph{N/A} is being displayed. This is
because there are not yet any released \emph{versions} of your product.
To make your product downloadable, you need to create a version of your
product and point it to the file you uploaded to your HTTP server
earlier.

Before you do that, however, you need to add a \emph{Framework Version}
to your software catalog. A Framework version denotes what version of
Liferay your plugin is designed for and works on. You cannot add a
version of your product without linking it to a version of the framework
for which it is designed.

Why is this so important? Because as Liferay gains more and more
features, you may wish to take advantage of those features in future
versions of your product, while still keeping older versions of your
product available for those who are using older versions of Liferay.
This is perfectly illustrated in the example My Summary portlet we are
using. Liferay had a My Summary portlet of its own, which does exactly
what we have described here. This portlet was added to the suite of
portlets which Liferay provides in the Social Networking plugin. This
plugin makes use of the many social networking features which have been
added to Liferay. So rather than just displaying a summary of your
information, the Social Networking portlet adds features such as status
updates, a \emph{wall} for each user in his or her profile that other
users can \emph{write} on, the ability to become \emph{friends} with
other users---thereby granting them access to their profiles---and more.

None of this would work in older versions of Liferay, because the core
engine that enables developers to create features like this is not
there. So in this case, you would want to keep the older My Summary
portlet available for users who have not yet upgraded and make the newer
social portlets available to those using latest version of Liferay. This
is what \emph{Framework Versions} does for you. If you connect to
Liferay's software repositories with an old version of Liferay Portal,
you will see the My Summary portlet. If you connect to Liferay's
software repositories with new version of Liferay, you will see the
social portlets.

So click the \emph{Framework Versions} tab and then click the \emph{Add
Framework Version} button.

Give the framework a name, a URL and leave the \emph{Active} check box
checked. For our example, we have entered 6.2.0 for the name, because
our portlet should work on that version and higher, and
\url{http://www.liferay.com} for the URL. Click \emph{Save}.

Now go back to the \emph{Products} tab and click on your product. You
will notice a message is displayed stating the product does not have any
released versions. Click the \emph{Add Product Version} button.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/marketplace-adding-product-version-software-catalog.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.10: Versions usually increment by \emph{.1} for every
new release.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Version Name:} Enter the version of your product.

\textbf{Change Log:} Enter some comments regarding what changed between
this version and any previous versions.

\textbf{Supported Framework Versions:} Select the framework version for
which your software product is intended. Enter a \texttt{+} at the end
of the version number if you want to specify a version plus any future
versions.

\textbf{Download Page URL:} If your product has a descriptive web page,
enter its URL here.

\textbf{Direct Download URL (Recommended):} Enter a direct download link
to your software product here. The Plugin Installer portlet will follow
this link in order to download your software product.

\textbf{Test Direct Download URL:} Select \emph{Yes} if you'd like
Liferay to test the download URL for its validity.

\textbf{Include Artifact in Repository:} To enable others to use the
Plugin Installer portlet to connect to your repository and download your
plugin, select \emph{Yes} here.

When you are finished filling out the form, click the \emph{Save}
button. Your product version will be saved and your product will now be
available in the software repository.

\subsubsection{Generating the Software
Catalog}\label{generating-the-software-catalog}

The Software Catalog works by generating an XML document which the
Plugin Installer reads. Using the data from this XML document, the
Plugin Installer knows where it can download the plugins from, what
version of Liferay the plugins are designed for, and all other data
about the plugins that have been entered into the Software Catalog
portlet.

In order to get your Software Catalog to generate this XML data, you
will need to access a particular URL. If you have created a friendly URL
for your site (for example, the default site, which is called
\emph{guest}, has a friendly URL of \texttt{/guest} already configured
for it), you can use the friendly URL. If not, you will first need to
know the Group ID of the site in which your Software Catalog portlet
resides. Obviously, it is much easier if you are using Friendly URLs,
which we highly recommend.

Next, go to your browser and go to the following URL:

\begin{verbatim}
http://<server name\>:<port number\>/software_catalog?<Friendly URL name or Group ID\>
\end{verbatim}

For example, if you are on the same machine as your Liferay instance,
and that instance is running on port 8080, and your group ID from the
database is 10148, you would use the following URL:

\url{http://localhost:8080/software_catalog?10148}

If you have also created a friendly URL called \emph{old-computers} for
this site, you would use the following URL:

\url{http://localhost:8080/software_catalog?old-computers}

If you have configured everything properly, an XML document should be
returned:

\begin{verbatim}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<plugin-repository\>
    <settings/>
    <plugin-package>
        <name>My Summary</name>
        <module-id>old-computers/my-summary-portlet/1.0/war</module-id>
        <modified-date>Thu, 20 Sep 2013 18:28:14 +0000</modified-date>
        <types>
            <type>portlet</type>
        </types>
        <tags>
            <tag>social</tag>
            <tag>profile</tag>
        </tags>
        <short-description>My Summary</short-description>
        <long-description>My Summary</long-description>
        <change-log>Initial Version</change-log>
        <download-url>
            http://www.liferay.com/portlets/my-summary-portlet-6.2.0.war
        </download-url>
        <author>Cody Hoag</author>
        <screenshots/>
        <licenses>
            <license osi-approved="true">LGPL</license>
        </licenses>
        <liferay-versions/>
    </plugin-package>
</plugin-repository>
\end{verbatim}

You can now give the URL to your software repository out on your web
site and other administrators of Liferay can enter it into the Plugins
Installation module of their Liferay Control Panels to connect to your
repository.

If you want to serve your repository off of a static web server, you can
save this document to a file called \texttt{liferay-plugin-package.xml}
and put this file on your HTTP server. You can then give out the URL to
the directory which holds this file on your web site and anyone with an
instance of Liferay will be able to point their Plugin Installer
portlets to it.

\subsubsection{Benefits of the Software
Catalog}\label{benefits-of-the-software-catalog}

As you can see, the Software Catalog makes it easy for you to create a
repository of your software. Users of Liferay can configure their Plugin
Installers to attach to your repository and the proper versions of your
software will be automatically made available to them by a single click.
This is by far the easiest way for you to keep track of your software
and for your users to obtain your software.

Another benefit of the Software Catalog is that you can make available
to your users a standard interface for manually downloading your
software. For those who prefer to manually download plugins, your
Software Catalog gives them an interface to go in, find your software
either by browsing or by searching, preview screen shots and download
your software---and you don't have to build any of those pages yourself.
Simply configure your software in the portlet and all of that is done
for you.

How can you do this? The Software Catalog is also available as a
portlet. You can add it to any page on your web site through the
\emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Applications} menu. You can find the portlet in the
\emph{Tools} category.

\subsection{Manually Creating A Software
Catalog}\label{manually-creating-a-software-catalog}

If you do not wish to use the Control Panel to create your software
catalog, you can create it manually by manually typing out the XML file
that the Software Catalog section of the Control Panel would normally
generate. Note that if you do this, you will not be able to use the
Software Catalog portlet as a graphical user interface to your software
that end users can use to download your software manually: you will have
to build this yourself. Keep in mind many instances of Liferay Portal
sit behind a firewall without access to the Internet. Because of this,
if you are making your software available to Internet users, some of
them will have to download it manually anyway, because their
installations are firewalled. In this case, the Software Catalog portlet
is the easiest way to provide a user interface for downloading your
software.

If you still wish to use a text editor to create your software catalog,
you can. To manually create a software catalog, obtain the DTD for the
XML file from Liferay's source code. You will find this DTD in the
\emph{definitions} folder in the Liferay source. It is a file called
\texttt{liferay-plugin-package\_6\_2\_0.dtd}. Use this DTD with a
validating XML editor (a good, free choice is jEdit with all the XML
plugins) to create your software catalog manually.

\subsection{Connecting to a Software
Catalog}\label{connecting-to-a-software-catalog}

If there is a software catalog of plugins you would like to point your
instance of Liferay to, all you need is the URL to the catalog. Once you
have the URL, go to the App Manager in the Control Panel and click the
\emph{Install} tab. You will see there is a field in which you can enter
a URL to a plugin repository.

Enter the URL to the repository to which you wish to connect and click
\emph{Save}. The portlet will connect to the repository and items from
this repository will be shown in the list.

If all this talk of catalogs has put you in the mood to do some
shopping, then it's probably a good time to get acquainted with
Liferay's Shopping application. Let's go down that aisle next.

\section{Shopping}\label{shopping}

Would your organization like to make some money selling promotional
items? Are you an artist looking to share your work with the world?
Perhaps your company produces a publication that customers want to
purchase? If you have something of value the visitors of your site want
or need, then Liferay's Shopping application can help you get these
items to your customers with a secure transaction.

The Shopping portlet uses PayPal and allows you to choose the credit
cards your store accepts. You can organize your inventory with
categories and subcategories. A search function helps users find items
quickly. Users place items in a shopping cart, allowing them to purchase
multiple items at once. There is also an email notification system to
alert customers when their transactions are processed.

Before we start printing money, let's first create an online store.

\subsection{Setting up shop}\label{setting-up-shop}

To begin setting up a store, place the Shopping application on a page in
your site. Like the Message Boards portlet, the Shopping portlet takes
up a lot of space. It's best, therefore, to dedicate an entire page to
the application. The Shopping portlet is available from the \emph{Add} →
\emph{Applications} menu on the left side panel under Shopping.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../../images/shopping-add-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.11: Start setting up the store by entering items and
categories in the shopping portlet.}
\end{figure}

The shopping portlet has four tabs across the top:

\textbf{Categories:} shows the categories of items in your store. For
example, if you're selling music, you might have categories for various
genres, such as pop, rock, metal, hip hop, and the like. The portlet
defaults to this view.

\textbf{Cart:} shows the items the user has selected to purchase from
your store. It displays the order subtotal, the shipping cost, and a
field for entering a coupon code. There are buttons for updating the
cart, emptying the cart, and checking out.

\textbf{Orders:} displays a list of all previous orders placed,
containing options to search for orders by the order number, status,
first name, last name and/or email address.

\textbf{Coupons:} lets you define coupon codes to offer discounts to
your customers. You can enter the coupon code, discount type, and
whether it is active or not. Search looks for a particular coupon offer
while Add Coupon opens a new form to key in the coupon data. Delete
removes a coupon.

Below the tabs are breadcrumbs for navigating between the categories and
subcategories you create. In fact, this would be a good time to start
creating some categories.

\subsubsection{Creating Categories}\label{creating-categories}

It's not difficult to create categories. Simply click the \emph{Add
Category} button to display the Category form. In this form enter the
\emph{Name}, \emph{Description}, and set the \emph{Permissions} for the
category. That's all there is to it.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/shopping-categories.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.12: In this figure there are three subcategories for
the \texttt{Aromatherapy} category. The first subcategory has three
items, the second has two, and the third is empty.}
\end{figure}

When you click \emph{Save}, your new category is listed in the portlet,
along with the number of subcategories and the number of items that are
in the category. You can edit the category, set permissions for it or
delete it using the \emph{Actions} button.

Each category can have unlimited subcategories and you can add
subcategories to any category. Notice as you add categories and
subcategories, navigational breadcrumbs appear in the portlet. Use these
to move through the store inventory.

\subsubsection{Creating Items}\label{creating-items}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/shopping-category-breadcrumbs.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.13: Breadcrumbs are an important navigational tool in
the shopping portlet.}
\end{figure}

When you select a category, you'll see its items appear. You create
items the same way you create categories. Use the \emph{Add Item} button
to open the new item form. Enter data for the SKU number, name,
description, and item properties. You can select checkboxes to specify
whether the item requires shipping and whether it is a featured item.
Enter the stock quantity to record how many items are available and set
the appropriate permissions.

The Fields area is where you add additional fields to set specific
characteristics for the item. These can include things like sizes and
colors. The additional fields appear in the item form as pull-down
menus.

The Prices area is for all data pertaining to the item's cost, minimum,
and maximum quantities, quantity discounts, taxes, and shipping costs.

The Images area lets you add photos to the item form. You can add a link
to the photo or upload the file locally. Choose from three sizes of
images. You must select the appropriate check box for the image you want
to display. When you're finished creating a new item, click \emph{Save}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/shopping-item-image2.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.14: The image in this figure is the medium sized
option.}
\end{figure}

As products are added, they are listed in the Items section of the
portlet. If the item you just created needs to go into one of your new
categories or subcategories, you can assign it to the category by
editing the item. Choose the \emph{Select} button (next to the
\emph{Remove} button), and this displays a dialog box listing all the
shop categories. Choose the desired category from the list to relocate
the item to its new location. Notice how the breadcrumbs reflect this
change in the item form. For a tutorial on categories, breadcrumbs, and
item relocation, visit the \emph{Moving a Link} section in this chapter.

You can make changes to any item through \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Edit}.
Finding an item is easy, using the \emph{Search} function.

That's how you create an item for the store. Now let's examine some of
the shopping portlet's configuration options.

\hyperdef{}{configuration}{\subsection{Configuration}\label{configuration}}

By selecting the \emph{gear} icon in the top right of the portlet, you
can manage the configuration options of the shopping application. In the
Setup view, there are tabs for Payment Settings, Shipping Calculation,
Insurance Calculation, and Emails.

\subsubsection{Payment Settings}\label{payment-settings}

The payment settings section is where you configure all the functions
related to transactions for your store.

\textbf{PayPal Email Address:} is the address of your store's PayPal
account which is used for payment processing.

Note that PayPal can be disabled by entering a blank PayPal address in
the field. Credit cards can likewise be disabled. Payments to the store
are not required when these settings are disabled. The credit card
function does not process payments; it instead stores the card
information with the order so you can process the transaction
separately.

\textbf{Credit Cards:} sets the type of credit cards your store accepts.

The Current column holds the cards your store takes. The Available
column holds cards not accepted by your shop. These can be moved easily
from one column to another by selecting a card and clicking one of the
arrow buttons. The arrows below the Current window allow you to choose
the order credit cards are displayed on the form.

\textbf{Currency:} sets the appropriate currency your shop accepts.

\textbf{Tax State:} sets the applicable state where your business is
responsible for paying taxes.

\textbf{Tax Rate:} sets the percentage of taxes your store is
responsible for paying. This rate is added as a sales tax charge to
orders.

\textbf{Minimum Order:} sets the minimum amount required for a sale.

\subsubsection{Shipping and Insurance
Calculation}\label{shipping-and-insurance-calculation}

Both the Shipping and Insurance forms have identical options.

\textbf{Formula:} sets the equation for determining shipping and
insurance costs. They're calculated on either a flat rate based on the
total purchase amount or on a percentage of the total amount spent.

\textbf{Values:} sets the shipping and insurance fees based on a range
of figures that the total order amount falls under.

\subsubsection{Emails}\label{emails}

This form sets the addresses for customer email notifications. Use the
list of term definitions below to customize the correspondence with your
customers.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/shopping-confirmation-email-form.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.15: Shopping emails can be configured in a myriad of
ways to suit your needs.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Emails From:} sets the email address from which order and
shipping notifications are sent.

\textbf{Confirmation Email:} Use this form to customize the email
message customers receive when an order is received.

\textbf{Shipping Email:} Use this form to customize the email message
customers receive when an order has been shipped.

So far we have added the shopping portlet to your site, created
categories and items for your store, set up payment options, and
configured customer communication options. These are the basics required
to get your store up and running. Now let's review the buying process.

\subsection{Using the shopping cart}\label{using-the-shopping-cart}

Logged in users are given a shopping cart to store the items they wish
to buy. Customers can manage items and their quantities directly from
the cart, allowing them to purchase a single product or multiple
products at once. Customers can also key in coupon codes to take
advantage of any discounts your store has to offer. Products can be
placed in the cart from any category or subcategory. The cart's
appearance can be customized to reflect the overall design of your
store.

When buyers select an item, they see the item's description displaying
all of its relevant information. The figure below is typical of what an
item's description might look like.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/shopping-item.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.16: Your product's SKU number is listed above the
image.}
\end{figure}

Below the product description is the Availability field indicating
whether the item is in stock. There are also two buttons for managing
the shopping experience:

\textbf{Add to Shopping Cart:} places the item in your cart for
checkout.

\textbf{Next:} lets you to scroll through all the items in the category,
giving you the option to add to the cart as you go.

After adding an item to the cart, click Back (blue arrow) to return to
the product description and continue shopping by navigating the category
breadcrumbs at the top of the form. You can also continue shopping by
scrolling through a category, item by item, using the \emph{Previous}
and \emph{Next} buttons at the bottom of the product description.

Each time you add an item to the cart, a running tally of the cart's
contents is kept. Quantities for each item are controlled using
drop-down menus. The order subtotal and shipping costs appear above a
field where coupon codes can be entered. When you have finished adding
products to the cart, you have three options:

\textbf{Update Cart:} lets you change the quantity of an item being
purchased. If a minimum number of items has been set in the item
description, the field under the Quantity column shows that number by
default. You can adjust the exact number of items you want with the
drop-down menus in the cart.

\textbf{Empty Cart:} lets you clear the contents of the cart to either
start shopping again or to stop shopping.

\textbf{Checkout:} sends you to a new form to verify the billing
address, shipping address, and the credit card information. You can also
add comments about the order if necessary.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/shopping-cart-order.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.17: The shopping cart gives a preview of the items
you'd like to buy.}
\end{figure}

When you're ready to checkout, click the \emph{Checkout} button at the
bottom of the screen. When all the data has been entered correctly,
click \emph{Continue} to see the order summary. After reviewing the
summary, click \emph{Finished} and you are given confirmation the order
has been placed, along with the order number. Use this number to search
for the order history and keep track of its status.

\subsubsection{Customizing the shopping cart with a
hook}\label{customizing-the-shopping-cart-with-a-hook}

If you think the shopping cart looks a little basic for your purposes,
you can customize it by using a hook. To learn more about changing the
appearance of the shopping cart, consult the
\href{http://dev.liferay.com/develop}{\emph{Liferay
Developer Network}} or see section 8.3 in
\href{http://manning.com/sezov}{\emph{Liferay in Action}}.

Now your online store is set up, you have inventory, you have a payment
system, and you have sales rolling in. All is good. Some day there will
be customers with questions about their orders. Let's go over the orders
next.

\subsection{Managing Orders}\label{managing-orders}

On the Orders tab, there are fields for finding specific orders. Search
for orders using the order number, order status, first or last name on
the order, or by the email address associated with the account. For more
information on searching in Liferay Portal, see the Faceted Search
section in chapter 6 of this guide.

Below the search fields is the orders list. Orders can be deleted or
edited using the \emph{Actions} button. When you select an order from
the Orders tab, or if you edit an order, you see a summary of the order
details along with some options across the bottom.

\textbf{Invoice:} creates a printer-friendly copy of the order that can
be sent to a customer.

\textbf{Resend Confirmation Email:} lets you notify the customer that
the order has been received and is being processed.

\textbf{Send Shipping Email:} notifies the customer that the order is
\emph{en route}. You can also include a tracking number with this email
to allow the customer to follow the delivery process.

\textbf{Delete:} removes the order from the system.

\textbf{Cancel:} closes the Edit view and returns the user to the main
orders view.

You can also add comments about the order and subscribe to the comments
to get any updates on the order.

\subsection{Managing Coupons}\label{managing-coupons}

The Coupons view of the Shopping application lets you provide coupon
codes for special sale events or other discounts. You can determine the
type of discount to apply and whether it is currently active. You can
search for coupons and create new coupons from this form.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/shopping-coupon.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.18: Create a coupon code automatically when you
select the Autogenerate Code box.}
\end{figure}

To add a coupon, enter the coupon code in the Code field. If no code is
specified, you can create one automatically by selecting the
\emph{Autogenerate Code} checkbox. After entering the coupon's name and
description, you can set the coupon's start and expiration dates.
Additional options let you activate the coupon and set it to never
expire.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/shopping-coupon-discount-limits.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.19: Customize your coupon parameters under Discounts
and Limits.}
\end{figure}

Under the Discount section, you can set the minimum order amount
required for the discount, the discount amount, and the discount type.
Types can be based on a percentage, a fixed amount, free shipping, or a
tax free sale. The Limits section lets you set coupon restrictions based
on a list of categories and/or SKU numbers.

\subsubsection{Integrating the Amazon Rankings
portlet}\label{integrating-the-amazon-rankings-portlet}

If your store sells books, you can use Liferay's Amazon Rankings
application to display them alongside the main shopping portlet. Both of
these are found in the Shopping category under \emph{Add} →
\emph{Applications} in the left menu. The Amazon Rankings application
lets you highlight the books in your store's inventory outside of the
typical category structure. Books are arranged in ascending order
according to Amazon's Best Sellers Rank. Book cover images displayed in
the portlet come from the images in the product's description.

\paragraph{Setting up your Amazon Web Services
account}\label{setting-up-your-amazon-web-services-account}

To use Amazon rankings, you must first setup an Amazon Associates
Program account. This gives you the \emph{associate ID tag} you need to
enter in your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. Then you need to join
the Amazon Product Advertising API group. This yields the \emph{access
key id} and the \emph{secret access key} that also must go into your
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file.

Amazon License Keys are available.\footnote{\url{https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html/}}

Add the following lines to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file and
populate the values for the associate ID tag, access key ID, and secret
access key. Ensure there are no spaces between the \texttt{=} sign and
the property values.

\begin{verbatim}
amazon.access.key.id=
amazon.associate.tag=
amazon.secret.access.key=
\end{verbatim}

Note that these keys are provided by Amazon for personal use only.
Please consult Amazon at \url{http://www.amazon.com} for more
information.

To obtain the \texttt{amazon.associate.tag}, visit
the Amazon Associate program\footnote{\url{https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/apply/main.html}} 
and apply, if necessary. Your associate tag is the \emph{Tracking ID}
listed in the upper left corner of the
Associates
Central\footnote{\url{https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/main.html}} page.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} Make sure to create your affiliate program before
generating an access key; otherwise, the access key will not be linked
to your affiliate program.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}
If your Amazon Web Services key is set improperly, you can't add books
to your Shopping portlet.

\paragraph{Setting up the Amazon Rankings
portlet}\label{setting-up-the-amazon-rankings-portlet}

After setting up your Amazon Web Services account, choose the books to
display in your store. Select \emph{Configuration} from the Amazon
Rankings portlet in the upper right corner. Go to the \emph{Setup} tab
and enter the International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) in the
textbox, separated by spaces. The portlet accepts 10-digit ISBNs
rejecting ISBNs that letters.

When you are finished setting up the rankings, books appear in the
portlet similar to the example below. Clicking on the book's cover image
opens the book's Amazon page.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/shopping-and-amazon-rankings.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.20: Using the Amazon Rankings application can be a
nice addition to your store.}
\end{figure}

Now that you have a good grasp on Liferay's Shopping and Amazon Rankings
applications, let's learn how to generate reports in Liferay.

\clearpage

\section{Generating Reports in Liferay}\label{generating-reports-in-liferay}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.25\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/ee-feature-web.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Liferay's Reports portlet allows administrators to create reports and
schedule report generation runs. In order to work, the Reports portlet
needs to be combined with an appropriate implementation such as the
JasperReports web plugin. You can use Liferay's Reports portlet to
create professional reports containing charts, images, subreports, etc.
When a report is generated, data is dynamically pulled from Liferay's
database into a template. Data can be pulled into Jasper reports via
JDBC and Jasper reports can be exported to many different file formats
including PDF, HTML, XLS, RTF, CSV, or XML. The Reports and
JasperReports plugins are available as apps on Liferay Marketplace. You
can purchase, download, and install the Reports and JasperReports apps
directly from your Liferay instance's Control Panel interface or you can
navigate to \url{http://www.liferay.com/marketplace} in your browser,
purchase and download the apps, and copy the \texttt{.lpkg} files to
your Liferay instance's \texttt{/deploy} folder.

\subsection{Using the Reports Portlet}\label{using-the-reports-portlet}

Once you've installed the Reports and Jasper Reports EE applications,
log in to your portal as an administrator and navigate to \emph{Site
Administration}. If your applications have been successfully deployed,
you'll find a \emph{Reports Admin} entry in the \emph{Configuration}
section on the left menu.

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1in]{../../images/reports-admin-site-admin.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.22: To check that the Reports EE and Jasper Reports
EE applications have been successfully deployed to your Liferay server,
look for the \emph{Reports Admin} entry in the Configuration section of
your Site Administration page.}
\end{wrapfigure}

The Reports Admin portlet has three tabs:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{Reports}
\item
  \emph{Definitions}
\item
  \emph{Sources}
\end{itemize}

The Reports tab shows a list of all generated reports. The Definitions
tab shows a list of report definitions. The most important features of a
report definition are the data source, which determines where to find
the data to be displayed in a report, and the template, which determines
which information to display and how to display it. The Sources tab
allows you to add new data sources which can be selected by report
definitions. Note: your portal's database is automatically set up as a
default data source called \emph{Portal}. The \emph{Portal} data source
does not appear on the Sources tab but is selectable on the form for
adding/editing a report definition.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/reports-admin-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.23: Use the \emph{Sources} tab of the Reports Admin
portlet to define data sources for report definitions. Use the
\emph{Definitions} tab to define report definitions, generate reports,
and schedule reports for generation. Use the \emph{Reports} tab to
browse through and download generated reports.}
\end{figure}

In order to generate a report, you need to a have one or more report
definitions configured. To create a report definition, you need a data
source and a report template. If you'd like to use your portal's
database as your report definition's data source, use the default data
source called \emph{Portal}. If you'd like to use a different data
source, navigate to the \emph{Sources} tab of the Reports Admin portlet
and click on the \emph{Add Source} button. Enter a name for the new data
source and enter the JDBC connection information:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Driver Class Name
\item
  URL
\item
  User Name
\item
  Password
\end{itemize}

For example, to connect to a MySQL database called \emph{data\_source}
installed on the Liferay server, you could use the following
credentials:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Driver Class Name: \emph{com.mysql.jdbc.Driver}
\item
  URL:
  \emph{jdbc:mysql://localhost/data\_source?useUnicode=true\&characterEncoding=UTF-8\-\&use\-FastDateParsing=false}
\item
  User Name: \emph{{[}MySQL User Name{]}}
\item
  Password: \emph{{[}MySQL Password{]}}
\end{itemize}

Click on the \emph{Test Database Connection} button to make sure that
you've entered the connection information correctly. Liferay will
respond with a success or error message depending on whether or not it
was able to connect to the data source. From the Reports Admin portlet's
Sources tab, you can see a list of all the data sources that have been
added. You can configure data sources' permissions to customize who can
edit them and you can delete data sources that should no longer be used.

Once your data source has been saved, make sure that your report
template is ready for use. If you're using Jasper and need to create a
Jasper template, consider using a tool like iReport Designer or
Jaspersoft Studio to create your template. iReport is built on top of
Netbeans IDE while Jaspersoft Studio is Eclipse-based.

Once you've created a Jasper template (\texttt{.jrxml} file), you're
ready to create a report definition. Liferay handles compiling the template,
populating the template with data, and exporting the report.  For more
information on using iReport Designer and on the Jasper Report lifecycle,
please refer to Jaspersoft's
wiki\footnote{\url{http://community.jaspersoft.com/wiki/ireport-designer-getting-started}}
and
documentation.\footnote{\url{http://community.jaspersoft.com/documentation?version=7114}}

To add a report definition, navigate to the \emph{Definitions} tab of
the Reports Admin portlet and click \emph{Add Report Definition}. Enter
a definition name and, optionally, a description. Select a data source
for your report definition. Remember that you can use your portal's
database as your database by selecting the default \emph{Portal} data
source. Then select a Jasper template (\texttt{.jrxml} file) for your
report template. Optionally, you can add report parameters and values to
your report definition and they'll be injected into the template at
runtime when the report is generated. Lastly, you can configure the
permissions of your new report definition. By default, new reports,
report definitions, and data sources are site-scoped. For this reason,
new report definitions are set to be viewable by site members. When
you've completed your new report definition, click \emph{Save}.

Now you're ready to use your report definition to generate reports
manually or schedule them to be generated. From the Report Admin
portlet's Definitions tab, click \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Add Report} next
to your report definition. You can choose any of the following reports
formats:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  CSV
\item
  HTML
\item
  PDF
\item
  RTF
\item
  TXT
\item
  XLS
\item
  XML
\end{itemize}

You can configure email notifications or specific email recipients.
Email notifications just inform users that a report has been generated
and provide a link to the report's location in the portal. Email
recipients actually receive copies of the report as email attachments.
You can customize the account from which report notifications and
deliveries are sent as well as the messages themselves from the
configuration window of the Reports Admin portlet. When generating a
report, you can also configure the permissions of the report to be
generated. By default, generated reports are site-scoped and are
viewable by site members.

To configure reports to be generated on a schedule, click \emph{Actions}
$\rightarrow$\emph{Add Schedule} next to your report definition from the Report
Admin portlet's Definitions tab. You can select a start date and,
optionally, an end date. You can also select how often to repeat the
report generation event:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{Never}
\item
  \emph{Daily}
\item
  \emph{Weekly}
\item
  \emph{Monthly}
\item
  \emph{Yearly}
\end{itemize}

As on the \emph{Add Report} form, you can select a report format,
configure email notifications and email recipients, and configure the
permissions of the reports to be generated. When you're done setting up
your report generation schedule, click \emph{Save}. Great! Now your
reports will automatically be generated on the dates you've configured.
You can create multiple reports from a single report definition. You can
also edit a report definition, configure a report definition's
permissions, or delete a report definition from the Report Admin
portlet's Definitions tab.

Once one or more reports have been generated, they'll appear in the
Reports Admin portlet's Reports tab. To edit a report's permissions or
to delete a report, use the \emph{Actions} button next to the report's
name. To view details about a report, click on its name. From the
details view of a report, you can download the report by clicking
\emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Download} next to the report file. You can also
deliver the report by clicking \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Deliver Report},
choosing an email recipient, and clicking \emph{Deliver}. To delete the
report file, click \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Delete}.

\subsection{Configuring the Reports Admin
Portlet}\label{configuring-the-reports-admin-portlet}

To configure the Reports Admin portlet, navigate to the Reports Admin
portlet in the Control Panel, click on the \emph{wrench} icon at the top
right corner of the portlet, and select \emph{Configuration}. There are
three tabs:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{Email From}
\item
  \emph{Delivery Email}
\item
  \emph{Notifications Email}
\end{itemize}

The Email From tab allows you to customize the name and email address of
the account that sends report notifications within your portal. For
example, you could set the name to \emph{Reports Admin} and the email
address to \emph{reports@liferay.com}. The Delivery Email tab allows you
to customize the email message that's sent when a report is delivered to
a portal user. When a report is delivered to a portal user, it's
included as an attachment to this email message. Finally, the
Notifications Email tab allows you to customize the message that's sent
when a report notification is sent to a portal user. In this case, the
report is not included as an attachment; the email message just provides
a link to the report's location in the portal.

\subsection{Using the Reports Display
Portlet}\label{using-the-reports-display-portlet}

Installing the Reports EE and JasperReports EE apps not only adds the
Reports Admin portlet to the Control Panel but also makes the Reports
Display portlet available. The Reports Display portlet provides the same
functionality as the Reports tab of the Reports Admin portlet. The
Reports Display portlet allows users to download or deliver reports but
not to add, edit, or delete report definitions or data sources.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/reports-display-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.24: Here, the Reports Display portlet shows only a
single report.}
\end{figure}

The Reports Display portlet is intended to be placed within a site's
private pages to allow site members to access site-scoped reports. It
can also be placed within a site's public pages. In this case, reports
will only be displayed to users that have permission to view the
reports. For example, if a guest views a site's public page to which the
Reports Display portlet has been added, site-scoped reports will not be
visible; only reports for which the View permission has been added to
the Guest role will appear in the Reports Display portlet.

\subsection{Creating a Sample Jasper Report in
Liferay}\label{creating-a-sample-jasper-report-in-liferay}

To create a sample Jasper report in Liferay, follow this section's
instructions. We'll use your portal's database as our report
definition's data source and we'll use a simple Jasper template that was
created using iReport Designer.

\begin{enumerate}

  Save the following Jasper template to a file named
  \texttt{sample-report.jrxml} somewhere on your machine's file system.

\end{verbatim}
\item
  Log in to your portal as an administrator, navigate to Site
  Administration, and navigate to the Reports Admin portlet.
\item
  Navigate to the Definitions tab and click \emph{Add Report
  Definition}.
\item
  For the definition name, enter \emph{Jasper Test}.
\item
  Leave the data source selection as the default: \emph{Portal}.
\item
  Browse to and select the \texttt{sample-report.jrxml} template that
  you created in step 1, then click \emph{Save} to create your report
  definition.
\item
  Click \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Add Report} next to your Jasper Test
  report definition, choose the PDF report format, and click
  \emph{Generate}.
\item
  Navigate to the Reports Admin portlet's Reports tab and click on the
  report you generated.
\item
  Click \emph{Actions} \&rrar; \emph{Download} next to the
  \texttt{sample-report.pdf} file.
\end{enumerate}

This report should list all of your portal's users, displaying the
userId, screenName, emailAddress, createDate, and modifiedDate of each
user.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

Now that we understand how to generate Jasper reports in Liferay, let's
see what the Knowledge base application has to offer.

\clearpage

\section{Knowledgebase}\label{knowledge-base}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.25\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/ee-feature-web.png}
\vspace{-15pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

Liferay's Knowledge Base portlet provides a means for creating and
organizing articles within a site. The knowledge base is perfect for
creating and organizing information more formally than in a wiki. For
example, it can be used to organize and display professional product
documentation. It's easy to set up the knowledge base with a workflow
that requires articles to be approved before they are published.
Additionally, it allows administrators to create article templates.
Templates can be used to insure certain kinds of articles possess a
common structure and include certain kinds of information. Knowledge
base articles can be categorized to make them easy to find. They can
also be organized hierarchically to form complete books or guides. The
Knowledge Base portlet is available as an app from Liferay Marketplace.
You can purchase, download, and install the Knowledge Base EE app
directly from your Liferay instance's Control Panel interface or you can
navigate to \url{http://www.liferay.com/marketplace} in your browser,
purchase and download the app, and copy the \texttt{.lpkg} file to your
Liferay instance's \texttt{/deploy} folder.

\subsection{Knowledge Base Display
Portlet}\label{knowledge-base-display-portlet}

The Knowledge Base app actually consists of four portlets that can be
placed on site pages as well as one that adds a page to Site
Administration. The four portlets that can be placed on a page are
Knowledge Base (Display), Knowledge Base Article, Knowledge Base Search,
and Knowledge Base Section. When placed on a page, the Knowledge Base
display portlet presents many of the same options to an administrator
that are available from the Knowledge Base page of Site Administration.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-display-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.26: The Knowledge Base Display portlet displays your
recently added articles in a list.}
\end{figure}

You can use the four links at the top of the Knowledge Base Display
portlet to control what it displays.

\emph{Knowledge Base Home:} shows you a list of all top level articles.

\emph{Recent Articles:} shows you a list of articles in order from most
recent activity to least recent activity.

\emph{Administrator:} shows you a list of all articles, regardless of
which ones are parents or children of the others.

\emph{My Subscriptions:} shows you a list of articles you are subscribed
to.

The \emph{Add Article} button is available from the Knowledge Base Home
or Administrator view of the Knowledge Base Display portlet or from the
Articles tab of the Knowledge Base page of Site Administration. Use this
button to create an article for the knowledge base. When creating an
article, you can use the same WYSIWYG editor you used to create wiki
pages. Articles, however, are not the same as wiki pages; they must be
created in HTML, not MediaWiki or Creole. Click the \emph{Source} button
in the editor to view the HTML source of what you've written or write
some HTML yourself.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-new-article.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.27: You can create a new Knowledge Base Article using
the WYSIWYG editor.}
\end{figure}

In addition to entering a title and creating content for your article,
you can use the editor to add attachments, add tags, and set
permissions. By default, view permission is granted to the guest role,
meaning anyone can view your article. After you're done using the
editor, you can save it as draft and continue working on it later or you
can submit it for publication. Your article may need to be approved
before being published, depending on the workflow defined for your
portal.

You can find the \emph{Permissions} button next to the Add Article
button in the Knowledge Base display portlet or on the Knowledge Base
page of Site Administration. Click this button to define permissions
that apply to the Knowledge Base Display portlet generally, not to
particular articles. Here, you can define which roles can add articles
and templates, which are granted knowledge base administrator
privileges, which can change permissions on articles, which can
subscribe to articles, and which can view templates.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-permissions.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.28: Set various permissions for each of your portal's
roles in the Knowledge Base Permissions interface.}
\end{figure}

Users may need to be granted access to the knowledge base page of Site
Administration in order to exercise some of the above permissions. For
example, suppose the user role has been granted the \emph{Add Article}
and the \emph{View Templates} permissions. A user will be able to add
articles from the Knowledge Base Display portlet but will need access to
the knowledge base page of Site Administration in order to view
templates. Note that the Knowledge Base Display permissions are distinct
from the Knowledge Base Admin portlet. The display permissions define
what a user can do with the Knowledge Base Display portlet on a page
while the admin permissions define what a user can do on the Knowledge
Base page of Site Administration.

\subsection{Knowledge Base Page of Site
Administration}\label{knowledge-base-page-of-site-administration}

The Knowledge Base page of the Site Administration interface has two
tabs: one for articles and one for templates. The \emph{Articles} tab
shows all the articles in the knowledge base and lets you perform
actions on them. The \emph{Templates} tab shows all the templates
defined in the knowledge base and lets you perform actions on them.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-control-panel.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.29: Administrators can control knowledge base
articles and templates from the \emph{Site Administration} →
\emph{Content} page.}
\end{figure}

Administrators can perform the following actions on an article:

\emph{View:} displays an article. From here, you can add a child
article, edit the article, change its permissions, move it or delete it.

\emph{Edit:} allows you to change the title and content of an article as
well as add attachments, select topics and add tags.

\emph{Permissions:} lets you configure the permissions on a specific
article.

\emph{Subscribe:} lets you to choose to be notified of any updates to a
particular article.

\emph{Move:} lets you change an article's position in the hierarchy by
choosing a new parent article for it.

\emph{Delete:} lets you remove an article from the knowledge base.

These actions are similar to the ones that can be performed from the
Administrator view of the Knowledge Base Display portlet. However, the
Knowledge Base Display portlet is intended to be placed on a page for
the end user so an additional action is available: \emph{RSS} is a link
to an RSS feed of an article. Also, the \emph{View} action is only
available from the Site Administration page since the Knowledge Base
Article portlet can be used to display an article on a page.

The Templates tab of the Knowledge Base page of Site Administration
allows administrators to create templates to facilitate the creation of
articles. A template basically functions like a starting point for the
creation of certain types of articles. Click the \emph{Add Template}
button on the Templates tab of the Knowledge Base page of Site
Administration to create a new template.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-new-template.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.30: As an administrator, you can add a new template
to your knowledge base by navigating to \emph{Site Administration} →
\emph{Content} $\rightarrow$\emph{Knowledge Base (Admin)}.}
\end{figure}

Navigate back to the Templates tab of the Knowledge Base page of Site
Administration. You can perform the following actions on a template:

\emph{View:} displays a template. From here, you can use the template to
create an article, edit the template, modify the permissions on the
template or delete it.

\emph{Edit:} allows you to change the title and content of a template.

\emph{Permissions:} allows you to configure the permissions on a
template. You can choose roles to have permission to update, view,
delete or change the permissions on templates.

\emph{Delete:} lets you remove a template from the knowledge base.

To use a template to create a new article, you have to view the template
and then click \emph{Use this Template}. This brings you to the New
Article editor with the contents of the template copied for you.

\subsection{Knowledge Base Article
Portlet}\label{knowledge-base-article-portlet}

The Knowledge Base Article portlet can be placed on a page to display an
entire article. When you first place this portlet on a page, it displays
the message \emph{Please configure this portlet to make it visible to
all users}. This message is a link to the configuration dialog box for
the portlet. Click \emph{Select Article} to choose an article to
display. Pick an article and then click \emph{Save}. When your page
refreshes it will display the article in the portlet.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-article-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.31: Display articles using the Knowledge Base Article
portlet.}
\end{figure}

The Knowledge Base Article portlet allows users to rate and comment on
the article it displays. There are also links at the top of the portlet
users can use to subscribe to an RSS feed of the knowledge base,
subscribe to the article, view the history of the article, or print the
article.

\subsection{Knowledge Base Section
Portlet}\label{knowledge-base-section-portlet}

The Knowledge Base Section portlet allows administrators to selectively
show articles associated with a specific section. For example, a news
site might have a \emph{World} section, a \emph{Politics} section, a
\emph{Business} section and an \emph{Entertainment} section. In order to
use sections, you need to set the \texttt{admin.kb.article.sections}
property in your knowledge base portlet's \texttt{portlet.properties}
file and redeploy the portlet. You can find the
\texttt{port\-let.pro\-per\-ties} file in the knowledge base portlet's source
directory. Updating the one in your server's directory won't work. Use
comma delimited section names to set the property, like
\texttt{ad\-min.kb.ar\-ti\-cle.sec\-tions=World,Pol\-i\-tics,Bus\-i\-ness,En\-ter\-tain\-ment},
for example.

Once you have defined some sections in your knowledge base's
\texttt{portlet.properties} file, your users will see a multi-select box
in the Add Article and Edit Article screens that allows them to select
which section an article belongs to. You can add any number of Knowledge
Base section portlets to a page and you can configure each portlet to
display articles from any number of sections.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-section-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.32: Here's an image of Knowledge Base Section
portlets being displayed on a page.}
\end{figure}

The Knowledge Base section portlet has some additional configurations
that allow an administrator to select a display style (title or
abstract), an article window state (maximized or normal), how to order
the articles, how many articles to display per page, and whether or not
to show pagination.

\subsection{Knowledge Base Navigation}\label{knowledge-base-navigation}

Wikis often have deeply nested articles that can be hard to find by
browsing. Liferay's knowledge base's ability to selectively display
articles makes it easier to browse than a Wiki. The knowledge base also
features some other aids to navigation. The Knowledge Base Search
portlet allows you to search for articles in the knowledge base. This
portlet presents the search results to you in order from most relevant
to least relevant.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-search-portlet.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.33: The Knowledge Base Search portlet helps you
search the knowledge base for keywords.}
\end{figure}

You can also use the Categories Navigation portlet in conjunction with
the Knowledge Base Display portlet. When both of these portlets are
placed on a page you can select a topic in the Categories Navigation
portlet and the Knowledge Base Display portlet will show all of the
articles that match the topic. You can create topics from the Categories
page of \emph{Site Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Content}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-catnavandkbdisplay-portlets.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.34: Use the Categories Navigation portlet to search
articles that match a specific topic.}
\end{figure}

You can select topics for articles when you are creating or editing
them.

\section{Akismet}\label{akismet}

Akismet is a web-based spam detection service. The Akismet app,
available from Liferay Marketplace, integrates Liferay with Akismet to
provide spam detection for Liferay's message boards, blogs, wikis, and
comments. When you install the Akismet app from Liferay Marketplace, two
portlets are added to the Control Panel: the \emph{Akismet} portlet is
added to the Configuration section and the \emph{Spam Moderation}
portlet is added to the Content section of Site Administration.

In order to enable Liferay to use Akismet, you need to visit
\url{http://akismet.com}, create an account, and generate an API key.
Once you've generated an API key, navigate to the Configuration section
of the Control Panel and click on \emph{Akismet}. Enter your API key
into the provided field and check the \emph{Enabled for Message Boards}
and \emph{Enabled for Discussion} boxes. The term ``discussions'' is
another way to refer to comment threads in Liferay. Optionally, you can
customize the \emph{Reportable Time} and the \emph{Check Threshold}. The
Reportable Time indicates the time in days after a post is created or
updated that it can be marked as spam or not spam. The Check Threshold
indicates the number of posts after which Akismet will no longer check
posts. After you've finished configuring Akismet, click \emph{Save}.

To see Akismet in action, add some message board posts or comment on
some existing Liferay assets. See if you can get Akismet to mark one as
spam. If Akismet doesn't mark a post as spam, you can always manually do
as an administrator. Once one or more posts have been marked as spam,
navigate to the Content section of the Site Administration section of
the Control Panel, then click on \emph{Spam Moderation}. Here, you can
find all the message board posts, discussions (comments), and wiki pages
that have been marked as spam. You can select all the posts that you
agree are spam and delete them. You can also select any posts that you
don't agree are spam and mark them as \emph{Not Spam}. If you're not
sure about a post, click the \emph{Actions} button and select \emph{View
in Context} to view the post in its original setting.

\section{Weather}\label{weather}

Liferay's Weather portlet displays basic weather-related information
(temperature, conditions) for multiple configurable locations. It's
available as an app from Liferay Marketplace. For each configured
location, a link to \href{http://openweathermap.org/}{Open Weather Map}
is provided that points to more detailed information. The Weather
portlet also provides a search bar that allows users to find information
about locations that aren't listed by the portlet. Searching via the
search bar forwards the user to \href{http://openweathermap.org/}{Open
Weather Map}, where the search is executed.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{\\Figure 14.35: Liferay's Weather portlet displays basic
weather-related information (temperature, conditions) for multiple
configurable locations.}
\end{figure}

To configure the displayed locations, open the Weather portlet's
configuration window. In the first text area, enter the names of the
cities about which you'd like weather information to be displayed.
Alternatively, you can use zip codes. Enter one city or zip code per
line. For the temperature format, you can choose between Celsius and
Fahrenheit.

\section{OAuth}\label{oauth}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.25\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/ee-feature-web.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Liferay's OAuth utility authorizes third-party applications to interact
with a user's resources. It's available as an app from Liferay
Marketplace. Let's say you're hosting Liferay Portal and have users and
customers coming to your web site. You want them to have access to a
third party resource, like Twitter, and be able to access their accounts
from your site. In the past, they would have to provide their Twitter
user names and passwords, but not if you use OAuth. For this reason, a
popular characterization for the OAuth client is the ``valet key for
your web services.''

OAuth is a handshake mechanism where, instead of asking for personal
information, Liferay redirects users to a service provider like Twitter,
where they can tell Twitter to allow Liferay limited access to their
accounts. This example is similar to our earlier ``valet key''
characterization. You wouldn't want a valet driver opening your glove
box, storage spaces, hood, and other personal compartments in your
vehicle. You would only want the valet to access what is necessary to
park your car. OAuth is based on this same idea: it gives a site just
enough information to do what it needs and nothing more. This assures
users that their personal information is safe, but gives them freedom to
take advantage of valuable resources they typically use from the service
provider's site.

\subsection{Registering OAuth
Applications}\label{registering-oauth-applications}

The first thing you'll need to do is register an application for OAuth's
services. To access the OAuth Admin page, navigate to the Control Panel
and, under the \emph{Users} heading, select \emph{OAuth Admin}. Then
select \emph{Add} to create a new OAuth application in the OAuth
registry. You'll be given the following options:

\textbf{Application Name:} the display name for your application

\textbf{Description:} the short description that is attached to your
application

\textbf{Website URL:} your application's URL

\textbf{Callback URI:} the URI where users are redirected after
authentication is complete

\textbf{Access Level:} select the \emph{Read} or \emph{Write} access
level. For the \emph{Read} access level, the user can only view the
application's contents, but not modify them. The \emph{Write} access
level gives the user permission to access and modify the application's
contents.

After you're finished registering the OAuth app, click \emph{Actions} →
\emph{View}. You'll notice Liferay generated two Application
Credentials: the \emph{Consumer Key} and \emph{Consumer Secret}. The
consumer key is a value used by the application to identify itself to
the service provider. Likewise, the consumer secret is a value the
application uses to establish ownership of the consumer key.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/oauth-app-credentials.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.36: You'll need the application credentials to
implement OAuth in your application.}
\end{figure}

Take note of your application credentials; you'll need them when
configuring your application with OAuth. To learn how to configure an
application with OAuth, visit the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/authorizing-access-to-services-with-oauth}{Authorizing
Access to Services with OAuth}. tutorial. Once you have your application
configured to use OAuth, visit the next section to begin authorizing
requests via OAuth.

\subsection{Authorizing Requests via
OAuth}\label{authorizing-requests-via-oauth}

Once you have your application configured to use OAuth, you can place
your application on a page and test out the process. Here is a basic
synopsis of what's happening during the authorization process.

The app you registered in the previous section and configured with the
consumer key and secret on the Developer Network\footnote{\url{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/authorizing-access-to-services-with-oauth}} is characterized as a
service provider. The service provider uses OAuth to allow users access
to its protected resources. These protected resources are data
controlled by the service provider, which can only be accessed by the
application through authentication. By configuring an application in
Liferay to use OAuth, you're keeping all private information you have
between a third-party service provider and the portal separate.
Essentially, OAuth bridges the connection between the portal and
third-party services without the user sharing any protected resources
between them.

Once your OAuth application is placed on a portal page, you'll be asked
to grant or deny the third-party service provider limited access to your
portal.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/oauth-authorize.png}
\caption{\\Figure 14.37: You can grant or deny the service provider access
to your.}
\end{figure}

Congratulations! You've successfully installed your OAuth app and
authorized access between a service provider and Liferay Portal!

\section{Summary}\label{summary-14}

In this chapter, we examined several Liferay utility applications: the
Bookmarks portlet, the Shopping portlet, the Software Catalog, the
Reports and JasperReports applications, the Knowledge Base, the Akismet
application, the Weather portlet, and the OAuth application.

The Bookmarks portlet allows users and administrators to collect and
share useful link to pages either within or outside of the portal. The
Shopping portlet allows you to use PayPal to set up your portal for
E-commerce activity. The Software Catalog allows you to define a set of
software items to make available to visitors to your portal. Remember
that the Software Catalog has been replaced by Liferay Marketplace. If
you want to use it, you'll have to manually install it as a plugin. The
Reports application is an EE-only application that provides a Reports
Admin portlet in the Control Panel for creating reports and scheduling
report generation. When combined with a suitable implementation, such as
the JasperReports application (also EE-only), you can upload report
definitions in the Reports Admin portlet, generate reports, and export
reports to a wide variety of formats.

The Knowledge Base application is an EE-only application that allows you
to create articles and organize them into full books or guides that be
published on your portal. The Akismet application offers a web-based
spam detection service for your portal's message boards, blogs, wikis,
and comments. The Weather portlet provides users with a summary of
weather-related information for multiple locations and provides a links
to \href{http://openweathermap.org/}{Open Weather Map} for more detailed
information for each location. Lastly, the EE-only OAuth application
manages third-party applications' access to your portal's resources and
vice versa. Next, let's take a tour of the Liferay Marketplace and learn
how to manage Liferay plugins.

\chapter{Leveraging the Liferay
Marketplace}\label{leveraging-the-liferay-marketplace}

Liferay Marketplace is an exciting hub for sharing, browsing, and
downloading Liferay-compatible applications. As enterprises look for
ways to build and enhance their existing platforms, developers and
software vendors are searching for new avenues to reach this market.
Marketplace leverages the entire Liferay ecosystem to release and share
apps in a user-friendly, one-stop site.

This chapter covers the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Users, Companies, and Apps
\item
  Accessing Liferay Marketplace
\item
  Finding, Downloading, and Installing Apps
\item
  Managing Apps
\item
  Plugins and Plugin Management
\item
  Plugin Types: Portlets, Themes, Layout Templates, Hooks, Web Plugins,
  and OSGi Bundles
\item
  Installing Plugins from Repositories
\item
  Installing Plugins Manually
\item
  Plugin Troubleshooting and Configuration Issues
\end{itemize}

In a nutshell, the Liferay Marketplace is a repository for applications
built on the Liferay Platform. You can find and download applications
directly from the Marketplace on the web or use an existing Liferay
installation to access and install applications onto the running Liferay
web site. Once installed, you can manage the applications through
Liferay's Control Panel.

\section{Marketplace Concepts: Users, Companies, and
Apps}\label{marketplace-concepts-users-companies-and-apps}

Anyone can browse the apps available on Liferay Marketplace at
\url{http://liferay.com/marketplace}, but a \texttt{liferay.com} user
account is required for purchasing and downloading apps. You can browse,
purchase, and download apps from the Marketplace website or from a
running Liferay portal. Accessing Liferay Marketplace from a running
Liferay portal makes it very easy to download and install apps. Once an
app has been purchased, it takes just one click to download the app and
one click to install it. Updating or uninstalling the app are also
one-click processes. A \texttt{liferay.com} user account is required
regardless of whether you access Liferay Marketplace via the browser or
via an existing Liferay installation.

Many official Liferay apps, as well as some third party apps, are
available free of charge. Other apps require you to pay a fee in order
to access them. When you purchase an app, you can do so on your own
behalf or on behalf of a company. Apps purchased on your own behalf are
associated with your personal \texttt{liferay.com} user account. Apps
purchased on behalf of a company are associated with the company's
account and can be accessed by any users who belong to the company. Once
you've purchased an app, you're free to download and install any
available version of the app whenever you like. We'll explain how to set
up a company account, manage company apps and join companies after we
discuss how to access Liferay Marketplace.

\section{Accessing the Liferay
Marketplace}\label{accessing-the-liferay-marketplace}

There are two ways to access the Marketplace.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Via the website: Using your favorite browser, you can navigate to the
  marketplace at \url{http://liferay.com/marketplace}.
\item
  Via Liferay: If you have a Liferay portal up and running, you can use
  the Apps section of the Control Panel to access Marketplace content.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Basics}\label{the-basics}

No matter which method you choose, you will see the same content and
apps.

If you are new to the Marketplace, the easiest way to access it is by
using your browser. Navigate to \url{http://liferay.com/marketplace} to
access the Marketplace home page.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-homepage.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.1: You can access and browse the Marketplace home
page without a \texttt{liferay.com} account but you need an account in
order to purchase and download apps.}
\end{figure}

In the center of the page, you will see a number of icons. Each icon
represents an individual app, and apps are organized by category:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  New and Interesting: The latest apps added to the marketplace
\item
  Featured apps: Liferay features a different set of apps each month
\item
  Most Viewed: The top 10 most viewed apps
\end{itemize}

If you click on the title of an app, you can access details about the
app, including a description, the author's name, screenshots, price,
latest version, number of downloads, a link to the developer's website,
a link to the license agreement for the app, a link to report abuse, and
a Purchase button. You'll also be able to view version history, read
reviews left by other users, or write your own review.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-app-details.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.2: Click on a Marketplace app to view details,
ratings, and reviews of the app.}
\end{figure}

If you click on the Purchase button, you'll be prompted to choose a
purchase type. You can purchase an app for your personal account or for
your company. If your company has already been registered, select it in
the drop-down list. If your company hasn't been registered, click the
\emph{Register Your Company} link to register your company with Liferay
Marketplace. Please see the \emph{Creating a Company} section below for
details.

The left side of each page in the \url{http://liferay.com/marketplace}
site contains a Marketplace navigation menu. This menu contains links to
various categories of apps available from Marketplace. Clicking on the
individual categories allows you to browse the apps in that category. To
view all the apps on Marketplace at once, click the \emph{Apps} link and
then the \emph{See All} link in the Apps portlet.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-browsing-apps.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.3: Click on the \emph{Apps} link in the menu on the
left side of the Liferay Marketplace homepage and then on the \emph{See
All} link in the Apps portlet to browse all the Marketplace apps at
once.}
\end{figure}

Below the navigation menu is the search bar. This search checks the
titles and descriptions of apps against your search terms.

\subsection{Logging In}\label{logging-in}

You do not need a \texttt{liferay.com} account in order to browse the
Marketplace. However, if you wish to purchase and download an app, you
need to establish a \texttt{liferay.com} account and agree to the
Marketplace Terms of Use. To get a new \texttt{liferay.com} account,
visit \url{http://www.liferay.com}, click \emph{Sign In}, then
\emph{Create Account}, and sign up! Once you are signed in, you can
fully utilize the Marketplace to find and use Marketplace apps.

If you are a developer and wish to create and upload new apps, you must
also register as a developer in Marketplace. Just go to
\url{http://liferay.com/marketplace} and click \emph{Become a Developer}
from the \emph{Marketplace} menu.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-registration.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.4: Click on the \emph{Become a Developer} link in the
menu on the left side of the Liferay Marketplace homepage to register a
developer's account, either as an individual or a company.}
\end{figure}

Once you register as a developer, your \emph{liferay.com} homepage will
have links for adding your apps to Marketplace, and managing them after
they're uploaded.

\subsection{Marketplace Profile}\label{marketplace-profile}

Once you register a developer account with your \texttt{liferay.com}
account, your existing \texttt{liferay.com} Home page will contain a new
section in the left navigation menu entitled \emph{Development}. You now
have two \emph{Apps} links: one under the main navigation menu and one
in the \emph{Development} section. The \emph{Apps} link under your name
is where you go when you want to vies and download yuor purchased apps
from the Marketplace. The \emph{Apps} link under the \emph{Development}
menu will let you manage existing apps and add new apps to the
Marketplace. To see information on your app's performance, use the
\emph{Metrics} link in the Development menu. If you submit an app, it
will be reviewed before appearing on the \texttt{liferay.com}
Marketplace.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Your \texttt{liferay.com} Home page is a private page. It's distinct
from your public \texttt{liferay.com} Profile page.
\vspace{20pt}
\end{roundedframe}
\subsection{Managing Apps}\label{managing-apps}

The \emph{Develoment} menu in your \texttt{liferay.com} home page is
where you'll go to manage and monitor your own marketplace apps, and the
\emph{Apps} link in your main navigation menu lets you view and download
apps you purchased from the Marketplace.

The Apps link in the menu under your name lists your purchased apps.
From this screen, you can find information about the authors of the apps
you have purchased and download or re-download the app (for example, if
you lost your copy or have re-installed Liferay and wish to re-deploy
the app). This option is also useful for downloading apps and deploying
them to offline instances of Liferay that do not have direct access to
\texttt{liferay.com}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-purchased-apps.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.5: On your \texttt{liferay.com} home page, the
\emph{Apps} link in the left navigation menu lets you view and download
your purchased apps.}
\end{figure}

If possible, it's best to log into your portal instance and install
purchased applications through the \emph{Store} link in the Control
Panel's \emph{Apps} section. This will provide your portal instance with
automatic update notices should they become available. If you download
applications this way, they can be hot-deployed.

The \emph{Development} menu is where developers go to manage their
Marketplace apps. The Apps link lists apps you have authored and
uploaded, and gives you an \emph{Add New App} link that let's you submit
an app to be added to the Marketplace. The Metrics link will show you
details such as the number of downloads, the current price and other
relevant information. Please see the
\href{https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/liferay-marketplace-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-11-en}{Marketplace
chapter of the Developer Guide} for details on this topic.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/marketplace-upload-app.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.6: This is part of the form you need to submit when
submitting an app to Liferay Marketplace.}
\end{figure}

Clicking on \emph{Add an App} allows you to upload a new app and make it
available in the marketplace. Please see the
\href{https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/liferay-marketplace-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-11-en}{Marketplace
chapter of the Developer Guide} for more detail on authoring your own
app.

\subsection{Creating a Company}\label{creating-a-company}

To create and register a company with Liferay Marketplace, click the
\emph{Become a Developer} link in the left-hand navigation menu of the
Marketplace home page. You can create an individual or a company
developer account. If you'd like to create an account on behalf of your
company, your first step is to see if your company already exists on
Liferay Marketplace. Enter your company name into the search box and
check if it's already been registered. If someone else from your company
has already created a company account on Liferay Marketplace, you can
click the \emph{Request to Join this Company} button. This will send an
email notification to your company's Marketplace admin (the one who
created your company's Marketplace account). Your company's Marketplace
admin will then be able to add you to the company. If the company name
you'd like to use is available, click the \emph{Register Your Company}
button to move on to the next step.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-creating-new-company.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.7: You can upload apps as an individual or on behalf
of your company.}
\end{figure}

Your second step is to fill out your company's information. The public
information you must provide includes a company logo, the company name,
a company description, a company email address and a homepage URL. The
private information you must provide includes a company address, your
company's country, region, city, postal code and phone number.
Additional private information required for validation includes a
company email address and a legal tax document. Once your company's
Marketplace registration has been approved, you will be your company's
Marketplace admin! This means you'll be responsible for handling
Marketplace users' requests to join your company. Don't worry, you don't
have to be stuck with this responsibility. Once you've added other users
to your company, you can promote some of them to be company Marketplace
admins too.

\section{Finding Apps}\label{finding-apps}

There are several ways to search for and find apps you are interested
in.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Browsing Categories: Click on a category (for example,
  \emph{Communication} or \emph{Productivity}) to see a list of
  interesting apps in that category. Upon clicking a category, you are
  presented with a list of featured apps for that category, as well as a
  canonical listing of all apps. Also, on the right, are lists of the
  Most Viewed apps within that category.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-browsing-categories.png}
  \caption{Figure 15.8: When searching for apps for your portal, you can
  browse through the complete list of Marketplace apps or browse by
  category.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Searching: To search for an app, type in search criteria in the search
  box under the navigation menu on the left and click \emph{Search}.
  Apps matching the specified search criteria are displayed.

\end{enumerate}

Next, let's talk about app versioning.

\clearpage

\subsection{Versions}\label{versions}

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/marketplace-search-box.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.9: You can search for apps using the search box in
the navigation menu. Results are returned if your search terms match
an app's title or description.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Apps are often updated to include new features or fix bugs. Each time an
app is updated, its version number is changed. The version number is
specified by the app developer and often follows established norms, such
as 1.0 $\rightarrow$1.1 $\rightarrow$2.0 or 1.0.1 $\rightarrow$1.0.2 $\rightarrow$1.2.0 and so on. Generally, the
higher the numbers, the newer the version.

When viewing an app's details, click on the \emph{Version History} tab
to see a list of versions of the app. In some cases, not all historical
versions of apps are available, depending on the app. Usually, you will
want to download and install the latest available app for the version of
Liferay you are using (See Compatibility below).

\subsection{Compatibility}\label{compatibility}

Some apps are written to work across a wide range of Liferay Platform
releases. Others are dependent on a specific Liferay Platform release
(or a handful of such releases). When viewing individual apps, each
version of the app that is available also describes the range of Liferay
Platform versions the app is compatible with. Make sure to choose a
version of the app that is compatible with your Liferay Platform
release.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-app-version-history.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.10: Look at an app's supported framework versions to
check if it's compatible with your version of Liferay.}
\end{figure}

To check if an app is compatible with your version of Liferay, click on
the App and then click on the \emph{Version History} tab. The Version
History tab displays not only the list of versions of the app but also
the app's supported framework versions and the dates of each version of
the app. The supported framework version of the app tells you whether or
not the app is compatible with your version of Liferay.

\section{Downloading and Installing
Apps}\label{downloading-and-installing-apps}

Once you've found an app you wish to download and install, click on the
name of the app to display its detailed information screen.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/marketplace-app-information.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.11: Click on an app to read a description and view
additional details.}
\end{figure}

This screen offers a number of items to help you learn more about the
app. You can find the primary information about the app on the left side
of the screen, below the app's icon. In the center display, you see a
set of screenshots along with a description of the app. Beneath the
screenshots, you can find a description of the app. Below that, you can
read reviews and view the version history of the app. Each app provides
at least the following information:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Author: The creator of the app. This can be either an individual or a
  company.
\item
  Rating: The average rating of the app on a scale from zero to five
  stars. The number of ratings is also shown.
\item
  Latest Version: The latest released version of this app
\item
  Total Downloads: The number of times the app has been downloaded
\item
  Supported By: Who to contact if you need support for this app
\item
  Developer Website: A link to the developer's own website
\item
  Purchase/Free: The button to click on to purchase the app. You must
  purchase an app before you can download it.
\end{itemize}

In the lower section, you will find Reviews and Version History tabs for
this app. Check this area to find out what other people are saying about
this app. In addition, on a separate tab, you will find the history of
versions for this app, where you can download other versions (for
example, if you are using an older version of the Liferay Platform, you
may need to download a specific version of this app that is compatible
with the version of the Liferay Platform you are using).

\subsection{Downloading and
Installing}\label{downloading-and-installing}

You've chosen an app, read the reviews and want to download and use the
app! There are two ways to install the app. Ultimately, both methods
result in the same outcome: the app you've chosen is installed onto your
local running Liferay instance.

\subsection{Liferay Hot Deploy}\label{liferay-hot-deploy}

Apps on the Liferay Marketplace consist of individual Liferay Plugins
(for example: a portlet, a hook, or a collection of multiple plugins).
Ultimately, these apps must be installed on a running Liferay instance
before they can be used. Deploying an app to a running Liferay instance
is automatically done through the process of \emph{hot deploy}. When
using your Liferay portal's \emph{Control Panel} to install apps from
the Marketplace, when you click \emph{Purchase} or \emph{Install} to
download and use a given app, it will be downloaded and hot deployed to
your local running Liferay instance.

For some Liferay installations, the hot deploy mechanism is disabled, in
order for the site administrator to manage (or prevent) the deployment
of plugins. In this case, the app will still be downloaded and stored in
the hot deploy directory (with a \texttt{.lpkg} extension in its
filename), but must be manually deployed using the custom process used
for deploying other plugins.

Please see the later section \emph{Installing Plugins Manually} to learn
more about hot deploy, its behavior on various app servers, and how to
manually deploy Marketplace apps in situations where hot deploy cannot
be used.

\subsection{Installing through the Control
Panel}\label{installing-through-the-control-panel}

The easiest way to install an app is to do so from your Liferay Control
Panel. This requires that you have already installed Liferay on your
local machine and that you can log in as an administrator. Once you are
logged in as an administrator, click the \emph{Admin} menu from the
Dockbar and choose \emph{Control Panel}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/marketplace-control-panel-entries.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.12: As an administrator, you can access the
Marketplace interface from the Control Panel of a running Liferay
portal.}
\end{figure}

Click on either the \emph{Store} or the \emph{Purchased} links beneath
the Apps heading. Before you can access Marketplace via the Control
Panel, you need to associate your \texttt{liferay.com} login credentials
with your local administrator account. Enter your \texttt{liferay.com}
email address and password so your Liferay installation can connect to
the \texttt{liferay.com} Marketplace.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-login.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.13: Before you can access Marketplace via the Control
Panel you need to link your \texttt{liferay.com} credentials with your
Liferay instance's administrator account.}
\end{figure}

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Tip: Any local user with administrative privileges can use the
Marketplace to browse and install apps from the Marketplace, by entering
their \texttt{liferay.com} credentials in the above login screen. This
allows multiple administrators to manage the apps installed on the local
Liferay instance. Once a link is established between a local
administrator account and a \texttt{liferay.com} account, there is no
way to undo this, short of re-installing Liferay.

\end{roundedframe}
Once you've successfully linked the accounts, you will be presented with
the same Marketplace screens that you'd see if you were accessing the
Marketplace webpage via your browser. You will be able to browse,
search, and install apps directly from the Marketplace. Click on the
\emph{Store} link under the Apps heading in the Control Panel to browse
the apps available from the \texttt{liferay.com} Marketplace. Browse to
the app you wish to install, click on the \emph{Purchase} or \emph{Free}
button, and then click on the appropriate button to confirm your
purchase on the next screen. The app will be downloaded and deployed to
your local Liferay installation.

You can view and manage all the apps you've purchased by clicking on the
\emph{Purchased} link under the Apps heading in the Control Panel.
Clicking on the \emph{Purchased} link shows you a list of those apps
which you've downloaded in the past, including apps you may have
purchased/downloaded while using other Liferay installations.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-purchased-apps-control-panel.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.14: Purchased Apps}
\end{figure}

The apps which you downloaded and installed on the currently running
instance of Liferay are listed as Installed. Apps which you have
previously downloaded or purchased on other Liferay instances that are
incompatible with the current one are listed as Not Compatible. You need
to re-download/re-install the appropriate version of these apps if you
wish to use them on your running instance of Liferay.

\subsection{Downloading through
liferay.com}\label{downloading-through-liferay.com}

The second way to install an app is to download it first, then in a
separate step, deploy it to your running Liferay instance. This is
especially useful in situations where you do not wish to deploy the app
directly to your production environment, or in cases where the target
Liferay instance that is to receive the app is behind a corporate
firewall or otherwise does not have direct access to the Marketplace.

In this case, using your browser, you will find the app on the
\href{https://www.liferay.com/marketplace}{Liferay Marketplace}. Once
found, click on the \emph{Purchase} or \emph{Free} button when viewing
the individual app. This will cause the app to be placed in your
\emph{Purchased} list on your personal Home page. Navigate to your Home
page and click on \emph{Apps}. Each app is listed; click on the one you
just purchased, or whatever app you want to download. You'll find a list
of app versions and Liferay versions. Choose the version of the app you
want, making sure the Liferay version corresponds to the version of the
Liferay installation where you'll install the app. Click \emph{App} and
the app is downloaded to your local machine in the same way any other
file would be downloaded. This file can then be hot-deployed to Liferay
by copying it to Liferay's hot deploy directory.

\section{Creating and Uploading Apps}\label{creating-and-uploading-apps}

Creating apps for the Liferay Marketplace is very easy and intuitive. To

Next, we'll discuss general Liferay plugin management. We'll explain the
differences between the various types of Liferay plugins and show how to
manually deploy plugins to Liferay.

\section{Plugin Management}\label{plugin-management}

One of the primary ways of extending the functionality of Liferay Portal
is by the use of plugins. \emph{Plugin} is an umbrella term for
installable portlet, theme, layout template, hook, Ext and web module
Java EE \texttt{.war} files. Though Liferay comes bundled with a number
of functional portlets, themes, layout templates, hooks and web modules,
plugins provide a means of extending Liferay to be able to do almost
anything.

\subsection{Portlets}\label{portlets}

Portlets are small web applications that run in a portion of a web page.
The heart of any portal implementation is its portlets, because all of
the functionality of a portal resides in its portlets. Liferay's core is
a portlet container. The container's job is to manage the portal's pages
and to aggregate the set of portlets that are to appear on any
particular page. This means the core doesn't contain application code.
Instead, all of the features and functionality of your portal
application must reside in its portlets.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} Liferay 4.4.2 and below support the Portlet 1.0 standard:
JSR-168. Liferay 5.0 and above support the Portlet 2.0 standard:
JSR-286. You cannot run Portlet 2.0 portlets in Liferay 4.4.2, but
because the Portlet 2.0 standard is backwards-compatible, portlets
written to the 1.0 standard still run in Liferay 5.x and above.

\end{roundedframe}
Portlet applications, like servlet applications, have become a Java
standard which various portal server vendors have implemented. The
JSR-168 standard defines the portlet 1.0 specification and the JSR-286
standard defines the portlet 2.0 specification. A Java standard portlet
should be deployable on any portlet container which supports the
standard. Portlets are placed on the page in a certain order by the end
user and are served up dynamically by the portal server. This means
certain \emph{givens} that apply to servlet-based projects, such as
control over URLs or access to the \texttt{HttpServletRequest} object,
don't apply in portlet projects, because the portal server generates
these objects dynamically.

Portal applications come generally in two flavors: 1) portlets can be
written to provide small amounts of functionality and then aggregated by
the portal server into a larger application or 2) whole applications can
be written to reside in only one or a few portlet windows. The choice is
up to those designing the application. The developer only has to worry
about what happens inside of the portlet itself; the portal server
handles building out the page as it is presented to the user.

Most developers nowadays like to use certain frameworks to develop their
applications, because those frameworks provide both functionality and
structure to a project. For example, Struts enforces the
Model-View-Controller design pattern and provides lots of functionality,
such as custom tags and form validation, that make it easier for a
developer to implement certain standard features. With Liferay,
developers are free to use all of the leading frameworks in the Java EE
space, including Struts, Spring MVC and Java Server Faces. This allows
developers familiar with those frameworks to more easily implement
portlets and also facilitates the quick porting of an application using
those frameworks over to a portlet implementation.

Additionally, Liferay allows for the consuming of PHP and Ruby
applications as portlets so you do not need to be a Java developer in
order to take advantage of Liferay's built-in features (such as user
management, sites, organizations, page building and content management).
You can also use scripting languages such as Groovy if you wish. You can
use the Plugins SDK to deploy your PHP or Ruby application as a portlet
and it will run seamlessly inside of Liferay. We have plenty of examples
of this; to see them, check out the Plugins SDK from Liferay's public
code repository.

Does your organization make use of any Enterprise Planning (ERP)
software that exposes its data via web services? You could write a
portlet plugin for Liferay that can consume that data and display it as
part of a dashboard page for your users. Do you subscribe to a stock
service? You could pull stock quotes from that service and display them
on your page, instead of using Liferay's built-in Stocks portlet. Do you
have a need to combine the functionality of two or more servlet-based
applications on one page? You could make them into portlet plugins and
have Liferay display them in whatever layout you want. Do you have
existing Struts, Spring MVC or JSF applications you want to integrate
with your portal? It is a straightforward task to migrate these
applications into Liferay, then they can take advantage of the layout,
security and administration infrastructure that Liferay provides.

\subsection{Themes}\label{themes}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-envision-theme.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.15: Envision Theme from Liferay's Theme Repository}
\end{figure}

Themes are hot deployable plugins which can completely transform the
look and feel of the portal. Most organizations have their own look and
feel standards which go across all of the web sites and web applications
in the infrastructure. Liferay makes it possible for a site designer to
create a theme plugin which can be installed, allowing for the complete
transformation of the portal to whatever look and feel is needed. There
are lots of available theme plugins on Liferay's web site and more are
being added every day. This makes it easier for those who wish to
develop themes for Liferay, as you can now choose a theme which most
closely resembles what you want to do and then customize it. This is
much easier than starting a theme from scratch. You can learn more about
theme development in \href{http://manning.com/sezov}{\emph{Liferay in
Action}} or the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop}{Liferay
Developer Network}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-murali-theme.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.16: Murali Theme from Liferay's Theme Repository}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Layout Templates}\label{layout-templates}

Layout Templates are ways of choosing how your portlets will be arranged
on a page. They make up the body of your page, the large area into which
you can drag and drop portlets. Liferay Portal comes with several
built-in layout templates. If you have a complex page layout (especially
for your home page), you may wish to create a custom layout template of your
own. This is covered in \href{http://manning.com/sezov}{\emph{Liferay in
Action}} or the \href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop}{Liferay
Developer Network}.

\subsection{Hook Plugins}\label{hook-plugins}

Hook plugins were introduced with Liferay 5.2. As the name implies, they
allow ``hooking'' into Liferay's core functionality. This means they
enable developers to override or replace functionality that is in the
core of the system. You can hook into the eventing system, model
listeners and portal properties. You can also override Liferay's core
JSPs with your own. Hooks are very powerful and have been designed to
replace most of the reasons for using the extension environment with
something that is easier to use and hot deployable.

\subsection{Web Plugins}\label{web-plugins}

Web plugins are regular Java EE web modules designed to work with
Liferay. Liferay supports integration with various Enterprise Service
Bus (ESB) implementations, as well as Single Sign-On implementations,
workflow engines, and so on. These are implemented as web modules used
by Liferay portlets to provide functionality.

\subsection{OSGi Bundles}\label{osgi-bundles}

OSGi (Open Services Gateway initiative) is a framework for developing
modular Java applications. Liferay 6.2 introduced support for the OSGi
module framework. It hosts an OSGi runtime and allows administrators to
deploy OSGi bundles to Liferay. OSGi web application bundles are very
similar to standard web application archives except that they must
include additional metadata so that they can operate in an OSGi
framework. The OSGi specification does not require a specific file
extension for web application bundles but they typically have a
\texttt{.jar} file extension. Sometimes a \texttt{.war} file extension
is used instead.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} Liferay 6.2's OSGi runtime is experimental and
unsupported. It should be considered a technology preview at this time.
\vspace{20pt}
\end{roundedframe}
Deploying an OSGi bundle to Liferay is easy: just copy the bundle to
your \texttt{{[}Liferay Home{]}/data/osgi/modules} directory.
Undeploying is just as easy: just remove the bundle from the
\texttt{{[}Liferay Home{]}/data/osgi/modules} directory. Note: If you
copy an OSGi bundle to your \texttt{{[}Liferay Home{]}/deploy}
directory, Liferay automatically copies it to your
\texttt{{[}Liferay Home{]}/data/osgi/modules} directory.

To test Liferay's OSGi module framework and deploy mechanism, you can
use the \texttt{test\--mo\-dule-frame\-work-shared} bundle from Liferay's
plugin repository on Github. \footnote{\url{https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/tree/master/shared/test-module-framework-shared}}
In order to deploy the module framework test plugin from a clone of the
liferay-plugins repository, you should first add the following lines to
your \texttt{build.{[}username{]}.properties} file in your
\texttt{liferay-plugins} directory. If this file doesn't exist yet,
create it.

\begin{verbatim}
liferay.home=[path-to-your-liferay-installation]
auto.deploy.dir=${liferay.home}/deploy
\end{verbatim}

Then navigate to the

\begin{verbatim}
liferay-plugins/shared/test-module-framework-shared
\end{verbatim}

directory in a terminal and run \texttt{ant deploy}. Of course, Apache Ant must
be installed on your system for this to work. When the
\texttt{test-module-framework-shared} bundle has been deployed, the
following message appears in the console:

\begin{verbatim}
Activate Test Component
\end{verbatim}

When you remove the \texttt{test-module-framework-shared} bundle from
the \texttt{\$\{LIFE\-RAY\_HOME\}/da\-ta/osgi/dep\-loy} directory, another
message appears:

\begin{verbatim}
Deactivate Test Component
\end{verbatim}

If you'd like to customize your Liferay Portal instance's module
framework behavior, please refer to the Module Framework section of the
\texttt{portal.properties} file. For example, you can set a
comma-delimited list of directories to scan for modules to deploy,
specify how to often to scan the directories for changes, etc. Remember
not to make customizations to the \texttt{portal.properties} file itself
but to instead add customized properties to a
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file in your Liferay Home directory.

\subsection{Configuring Plugins}\label{configuring-plugins}

Liferay Portal has a section of the Control Panel called Plugins
Configuration, which you can find under the Apps heading of the Control
Panel. The Plugins Configuration section not only allows you to see what
plugins are installed on your portal, but also enables you to configure
which portal roles can access certain plugins. It also allows you to
activate or deactivate portlet plugins. From the Control Panel, click on
\emph{Plugins Configuration} to find an interface which allows you to
view and manage installed portlet, theme, and layout template plugins.

The default view of the Plugins Configuration section shows which
plugins are already installed on the system. For portlet plugins, you
can click on the plugin's name to view whether or not it's active and to
view or configure the portlet's permissions. You don't have to uninstall
a plugin to prevent users from accessing the plugin's functionality;
instead, you can deactivate the plugin. To deactivate a plugin, click on
the plugin's name in the Plugins Configuration section of the Control
Panel and remove the flag from the \emph{Active} checkbox. Then click
\emph{Save}. To reactive the plugin later, just flag the \emph{Active}
checkbox again and click \emph{Save}.

On the Portlet Plugins tab, you have to click on a specific portlet in
order to view the plugin's active/inactive status and to configure the
portlet's permissions. The active/inactive status doesn't apply to
themes or layout templates: if a theme or layout template has been
installed, then it's available for use. The Theme and Layout Template
Plugins tabs of the Plugins Configuration section directly display which
portal roles can access them.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-plugins-installation-portlet-tab.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.17: Plugins Installation Portlet Tab Default View}
\end{figure}

It's easy to browse through the lists of installed plugins since the
plugins are listed alphabetically. You can also change the number of
items per page and navigate to a specific page if you know where a
particular plugin appears in the list. This is a standard feature of
Liferay and you will see it in most of Liferay's portlets.

Note that the Plugins Configuration section of the Control Panel is for
basic configuration: it allows you to active or deactivate portlet
plugins, view the existing permissions configuration for various plugins
and/or modify the configurations for existing roles. If you need to add
permissions to new roles for certain portlets, use the Roles section of
the Control Panel and the \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Define Permissions}
button. Next, let's learn how to install plugins manually.

\subsection{Installing Plugins
Manually}\label{installing-plugins-manually}

Installing plugins manually is not quite as easy as installing plugins
via the Marketplace interface but it's still quite simple. There are
several scenarios in which you would need to install plugins manually
rather than from Liferay's repositories:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Your server is firewalled without access to the Internet. This makes
  it impossible for your instance of Liferay to connect to the plugin
  repositories.
\item
  You are installing portlets which you have either purchased from a
  vendor, downloaded separately or developed yourself.
\item
  For security reasons, you do not want to allow portal administrators
  to install plugins from the Internet before they are evaluated.
\end{itemize}

You can still use the Control Panel to install plugins that are not
available from the online repositories. This is by far the easiest way
to install plugins.

If your server is firewalled, you will not be able to install plugins
directly from the Liferay Marketplace. Instead, you will need to
download the \texttt{.lpkg} file (in the case of a Marketplace app) or
\texttt{.war} file (in the case of an individual plugin). Then navigate
to the Control Panel and click on \emph{App Manager} under the Apps
heading. Then click on \emph{Install}. This gives you a simple interface
for installing an \texttt{.lpkg} or \texttt{.war} file containing an app
or plugin to your Liferay Portal. Use the \emph{File Upload} option to
browse to and install from a local \texttt{.lpkg} or \texttt{.war} file.
Use the \emph{URL} option to install from a remote \texttt{.lpkg} or
\texttt{.war} file.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/marketplace-plugin-installer-upload-file.png}
\caption{\\Figure 15.18: Installing a Plugin Manually}
\end{figure}

That's all the information the App Manager needs in order to deploy your
portlet, theme, layout template, hook, or web plugin. Click the
\emph{Install} button and your plugin will be uploaded to the server and
deployed. If it is a portlet, theme, or layout template you should see
it in the appropriate tab of the Plugins Configuration interface.

If you do not wish to use the App Manager to deploy plugins, you can
also deploy them at the operating system level. The first time Liferay
starts, it creates a \emph{hot deploy} folder which is, by default,
created inside the Liferay Home folder. This folder generally resides
one directory up from where your application server is installed, though
it may be elsewhere depending on which application server you are
running. To find out where the Liferay Home folder is for your
application server, please see the section on your server in this
guide's
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/6-2/installation-and-setup}{Installation
and Setup} chapter. The first time Liferay is launched, it creates a
folder structure in Liferay Home to house various configuration and
administrative data. One of the folders it creates is called
\emph{deploy}. If you copy a portlet or theme plugin into this folder,
Liferay hot deploys it and makes it available for use just as though
you'd installed it via App Manager in the Control Panel. In fact, this
is what the App Manager does behind the scenes.

You can change the defaults for this directory structure so it is stored
anywhere you like by modifying the appropriate properties in your
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. Please see the above section on the
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file for more information.

To have Liferay hot deploy a plugin, copy the plugin into your hot
deploy folder, which by default is in
\texttt{{[}Liferay Home{]}/deploy}. If you are watching the Liferay
console, you should see messages like the following ones:

\begin{verbatim}
16:11:47,616 INFO [PortletAutoDeployListener:71] Copying portlets for
/Users/stephenkostas/java/liferay/bundles/liferay-portal-6.0.4/deploy/weather-portlet-6.0.4.1.war

weather-portlet is available for use
\end{verbatim}

The \emph{available for use} message means your plugin was installed
correctly and is available for use in the portal.

\subsection{Plugin Troubleshooting}\label{plugin-troubleshooting}

Sometimes plugins fail to install. There can be different reasons for
installation failure based on several factors, including

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Liferay configuration
\item
  The container upon which Liferay is running
\item
  Changing the configuration options in multiple places
\item
  How Liferay is being launched
\end{itemize}

You can often tell whether or not you have a plugin deployment problem
by looking at the Liferay server console. If the hot deploy listener
recognizes the plugin, you'll see a \emph{plugin copied successfully}
message. If this message is not followed up by an \emph{available for
use} message then you have an issue with your plugin deployment
configuration, probably due to one of the factors listed above.

Let's take a look at each of these factors.

\subsubsection{Liferay Configuration
Issues}\label{liferay-configuration-issues}

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} This applies to Liferay versions prior to version 4.3.5.
Liferay versions above 4.3.5 are able to auto detect the type of server
it is running on, which makes things a lot easier. If you are running a
newer version of Liferay, you can skip this section. If you are
upgrading from one of these versions, continue reading.

\end{roundedframe}
Liferay by default comes as a bundle or as a \texttt{.war} file. Though
every effort has been made to make the \texttt{.war} file as generic as
possible, sometimes the default settings are inappropriate for the
container upon which Liferay is running. Most of these problems were
resolved in Liferay 4.3.5 with the addition of code that allows Liferay
to determine which application server it is running on and adjust the
way it deploys plugins as a result. If you have upgraded from one of
these older versions, you may still have settings in your
\texttt{portal.ext.properties} file that are no longer needed. One of
these settings is the manual override of the default value of
\texttt{auto.deploy.dest.dir}.

In versions of Liferay prior to 4.3.5, there is a property called
\texttt{auto.deploy.dest.dir} that defines the folder where plugins are
deployed after the hot deploy utilities have finished preparing them.
This folder maps to a folder the container defines as an auto-deploy or
a hot deploy folder. By default in older versions of Liferay, this
property is set to \texttt{../web\-apps}. This default value works for
Tomcat containers (if Tomcat has been launched from its \texttt{bin}
folder) but will not work for other containers that define their hot
deploy folders in a different place. In newer versions of Liferay, this
value is automatically set to the default for the application server
upon which Liferay is running.

For example, Glassfish defines the hot deploy folder as a folder called
\texttt{autodeploy} inside the domain folder where your server is
running. By default, this is in
\texttt{[Glassfish Home]/domains/domain1/autodeploy}.
JBoss defines the hot deploy folder as a root folder inside the
server configuration you are using. By default, this is in
\texttt{[JBoss Home]\-/server/default/deploy}.
WebLogic defines this folder inside the domain directory. By default,
this is in
\texttt{[Bea Home]/user\_projects/domains/[domain name]/auto\-deploy}.

The best thing to do when upgrading to newer versions of Liferay Portal
is to remove this property altogether. It is not needed, as the
autodetection of the container handles the hot deploy location. If, for
whatever reason, you need to customize the location of the hot deploy
folder, follow the instructions below.

You will first need to determine where the hot deploy folder is for the
container you are running. Consult your product documentation for this.
Once you have this value, there are two places in which you can set it:
in the \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file and in the Plugin Installer
portlet.

To change this setting in the \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file,
browse to where Liferay was deployed in your application server. Inside
of this folder should be a \texttt{WEB-INF/clas\-ses} folder. Here you
will find the \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. Open this file in a
text editor and look for the property \texttt{auto.deploy.dest.dir}. If
it does not appear in the file, you can add it. The safest way to set
this property, as we will see later, is to define the property using an
absolute path from the root of your file system to your application
server's hot deploy folder. For example, if you are using Glassfish, and
you have the server installed in \texttt{/java/glassfish}, your
\texttt{auto.deploy.dest.dir} property would look like the following:

\begin{verbatim}
auto.deploy.dest.dir=/java/glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy
\end{verbatim}

Remember, if you are on a Windows system, use forward slashes instead of
back slashes, like so:

\begin{verbatim}
auto.deploy.dest.dir=C:/java/glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy
\end{verbatim}

Save the file and then restart your container. Now plugins should
install correctly.

If you are having hot deploy trouble in Liferay versions 4.3.5 and
greater, it is possible the administrator of your application server has
changed the default folder for auto deploy in your application server.
In this case, you would want to set \texttt{auto.deploy.dest.dir} to the
customized folder location as you would with older versions of Liferay.
In Liferay 4.3.5 and greater, this setting still exists but is blank.
Add the property to your \texttt{por\-tal-ext\-.prop\-er\-ties} file and set its
value to the fully qualified path to the auto deploy folder configured
in your application server.

\subsubsection{Deploy Issues for Specific
Containers}\label{deploy-issues-for-specific-containers}

Some containers, such as WebSphere®, don't have a hot deploy feature.
Unfortunately, these containers do not work with Liferay's hot deploy
system. But this does not mean you cannot install plugins on these
containers. You can deploy plugins manually using the application
server's deployment tools. Liferay is able to pick up the portlet
plugins once they get deployed to the container manually, especially if
you add it to the same Enterprise Application project that was created
for Liferay.

When Liferay hot deploys portlet and theme \texttt{.war} files, it
sometimes makes modifications to those files right before deployment. In
order to successfully deploy plugins using an application server
vendor's tools, you will want to run your plugins through this process
before you attempt to deploy them.

Navigate back to the \emph{Configuration} tab of the Plugin Installer.
Enter the location you would like plugin \texttt{.war} files to be
copied to after they are processed by Liferay's plugin installer process
into the \emph{Destination Directory} field. You will use this as a
staging directory for your plugins before you install them manually with
your server's deployment tools. When you are finished, click
\emph{Save}.

Now you can deploy plugins using the Plugin Installer portlet or by
dropping \texttt{.war} files into your auto deploy directory. Liferay
will pick up the files, modify them and then copy the result into the
destination directory you have configured. You may then deploy them from
here to your application server.

\item
  If you don't have one already, create a \texttt{portal-ext.properties}
  file in the Liferay Home folder of your Liferay installation. Add the
  following directive to it:

  auto.deploy.dest.dir=\$\{liferay.home\}/websphere-deploy
\item
  Create a folder called \texttt{websphere-deploy} inside your
  \texttt{\$LIFERAY\_HOME} folder. This is the folder where the Lucene
  index, Jackrabbit config and deploy folders are.
\item
  Make sure the \texttt{web.xml} file inside the plugin you want to
  install has the following context parameter in it:

  com.ibm.websphere.portletcontainer.PortletDeploymentEnabled

  false
\end{enumerate}

Liferay versions 5.2.2 and higher will automatically inject this into
the \texttt{web.xml} file on WebSphere containers.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  The WebSphere deploy occurs in two steps. You will first use Liferay's
  tools to ``pre-deploy'' the file and then use WebSphere's tools to do
  the actual deployment. This is because Liferay makes deployment-time
  modifications to the plugins right before they are actually deployed
  to the application server. For other application servers, this can
  usually be done in one step, because Liferay can make the
  modifications and then copy the resulting \texttt{.war} file into an
  autodeploy folder to have it actually deployed. Because WebSphere does
  not have an autodeploy feature, we need to separate these two steps.
\item
  Deploy your .war file using Liferay's Plugin Installer or by copying
  it into \texttt{\$LIFE\-RAY\_HOME\-/deploy}. Liferay will make its
  modifications, and because we changed the
  \texttt{au\-to.dep\-loy\-.dest\-.dir} in the first step, it will copy the
  resulting \texttt{.war} file into
  \texttt{\$LIFE\-RAY\_HOME/web\-sphere-dep\-loy}. You will see a \emph{copied
  successfully} message in the log.
\item
  Use WebSphere's tools to deploy the \texttt{.war} file. Make the
  context root for the \texttt{.war} file equal to the file name (i.e.,
  \texttt{/my-first-portlet}). Once the \texttt{.war} file is deployed,
  save it to the master configuration.
\item
  Go back to the \emph{Applications $\rightarrow$Enterprise Applications} screen in
  the WebSphere Admin Console. You will see your portlet is deployed but
  not yet started. Start it.
\item
  Liferay will immediately recognize the portlet has been deployed and
  register it. The portlet will be automatically started and registered
  upon subsequent restarts of WebSphere.
\end{enumerate}

Experienced WebSphere system administrators can further automate this by
writing a script which watches the \texttt{websphere-deploy} directory
and uses \texttt{wsadmin} commands to then deploy plugins automatically.

\subsubsection{Changing the Configuration Options in Multiple
Places}\label{changing-the-configuration-options-in-multiple-places}

Sometimes, especially during development when several people have
administrative access to the server at the same time, the auto deploy
folder location may inadvertently be customized in both the
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file and in the Control Panel. If this
happens, the value in the Control Panel takes precedence over the value
in the properties file. If you go into the Control Panel and change the
value to the correct setting, plugin deployment will start working
again.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-15}

In this chapter, we introduced Liferay Marketplace, your one-stop shop
for browsing and downloading Liferay-compatible applications. We looked
at how to browse, purchase, download, and install apps. You can do this
either through \url{liferay.com/marketplace} or through Liferay Portal's
Control Panel. When you purchase apps, you can do so via your personal
account or on your company's behalf. For information about developing
and uploading apps to Liferay Marketplace, please see the Marketplace
chapter of the Liferay Developer guide at
\url{http://www.liferay.com/marketplace/developer-guide}.

After discussing Liferay Marketplace, we discussed general plugin
management. We covered Liferay portlet plugins as well as layout, theme,
hook, Ext, and web plugins. Finally, we looked at how to manually deploy
plugins to Liferay and discussed some configuration issues.

\chapter{User Management}\label{user-management}

You know how all these retailers advertise themselves as a ``one stop
shop'' for anything you want? The idea is they have so much stuff that
chances are whatever you're looking for is there. Liferay's Control
Panel is something like this. If you want to create users,
organizations, sites, configure permissions and plugins and pretty much
anything else, you can do it from the Control Panel. When signed in to
Liferay as an administrator, you can access the Control Panel from the
Dockbar by clicking \emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Control Panel}.

The Control Panel is organized into four main areas: Users, Sites, Apps,
and Configuration. The Users section lets you create and manage users,
organizations, user groups, roles, and password policies. If monitoring
has been enabled for your portal, you can also view all of the live
portal sessions of your users from this area of the Control Panel. If
the Audit plugins have been installed from
\href{https://www.liferay.com/marketplace}{Liferay Marketplace}, the
Audit section also appears.

In this chapter, you'll learn everything having to do with managing
users, and you'll see examples of some of the user management concepts
discussed earlier:

\begin{itemize}

\item

\item
  User Groups

  Monitoring
\item
  Audit Trails
\end{itemize}

Let's begin examining Liferay's Control Panel by looking at how to
manage users in Liferay Portal.

\section{The Users Section of the Control
Panel}\label{the-users-section-of-the-control-panel}

The Users section of the Control Panel is used for most administrative
tasks involving user management. There, you'll find an interface for the
creation and maintenance of the following portal entities: users,
organizations, user groups, and roles.

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/users-section-control-panel.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.1: The Users section of the Control Panel allows
portal administrators to manage users, organizations, user groups, and
roles. It also allows administrators to monitor users' live portal
sessions if monitoring has been enabled for the portal.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Since we explained how to manage sites, teams, site templates, and page
templates in chapters 2 and 3, we won't discuss them in detail here.
Nevertheless, remember that it's possible and sometimes simpler to use
sites, site memberships, and teams to organize users and manage
permissions than it is to use organizations, user groups, and custom
roles.

As a portal administrator, you'll use the Users section of the Control
Panel to create users, organizations, and user groups, implement
security via roles and permissions, and administer your users. Note that
only users with the administrator role, which is a portal scoped role,
have permission to view the Control Panel. You can, of course, grant
permissions to view one or more sections, such as the Users section, to
custom roles.

\subsection{Adding and Editing Users}\label{adding-and-editing-users}

Are you using Liferay's default administrative user, Test Test
(test@liferay.com)? If so, let's add a user account for yourself and
configure your new account so it has the same administrative access as
the default administrator account. From the Dockbar, click \emph{Admin}
and select \emph{Control Panel}. Then click on \emph{Users and
Organizations}. Click the \emph{Add} button and select \emph{User}. Fill
out the Add User form using your name and email address. When you are
finished, click \emph{Save}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-add-user-screen.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.2: You need to at least enter a screen name, email
address, and first name in order to create a new user account.}
\end{figure}

After you submit the form, the page reloads with a success message. An
expanded form appears that allows you to fill out a lot more information
about the user. You don't have to fill anything else out right now. Just
note that when the user account was created, a password was
automatically generated. If Liferay was correctly installed and a mail
server was set up (see chapter 14), an email message with the user's new
password was sent to the user's email address. This, of course, requires
that Liferay can properly communicate with your SMTP mail server.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-user-account-editor.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.3: Once you've completed the basic form for creating
a new user account, you'll see a much more detailed form for editing the
user and adding additional information.}
\end{figure}

If you haven't yet set up your mail server, you'll need to use this page
to change the default password for your user account to something you
can remember. You can do this by clicking on the \emph{Password} link in
the box on the right, entering the new password in the two fields and
clicking \emph{Save}. Next, you should give your user account the same
administrative rights as the default administrator's account. This
allows you to perform administrative tasks with your own account instead
of having to use the default administrator account. In production, you
should always delete or disable the default administrator account to
secure your portal.

On the form for editing a user, click the \emph{Roles} link in the menu
on the right side of the screen. This page shows the roles to which your
account is currently assigned. You should have one role: Power User. By
default, all users are assigned the Power User role. The Power User role
doesn't grant any special permissions. It can safely be ignored.
Alternatively, it can be used to extend the User role. If there are
certain custom permissions that you'd like all of your portal users to
have, you can grant these custom permissions to the Power User role. You
can also customize the default roles a new user receives via
\emph{Default User Associations}. We'll learn to do this when we look at
Portal Settings in the next chapter.

We want to assign the Administrator role to our user account. On the
form for editing a user, after having clicked on \emph{Roles} at the
right side of the screen, click the \emph{Select} link under Regular
Roles. A dialog box pops up with a list of all the regular
(portal-scoped) roles in the portal. Select the Administrator role from
the list. The dialog box disappears and the role is added to the list of
roles associated with your account. Don't forget to click the
\emph{Save} button which is at the bottom of the blue bar of links on
the right side of the screen. You are now a portal administrator. Log
out of the portal and then log back in with your own user account. Next,
let's look at some other aspects of user management.

\subsection{User Management}\label{user-management-1}

If you click on \emph{Users and Organizations} in the Control Panel, you
should now see your user account in the list of users. If you want to
change something about a particular user, you can click the
\emph{Actions} button next to that user.

\textbf{Edit:} takes you back to the Edit User page where you can modify
any aspect of the user account including the screen name, email address,
first name, last name, site and organization memberships, roles, etc.

\textbf{Permissions:} allows you to define which roles have permissions
to edit the user.

\textbf{Manage Pages:} allows you to edit the personal pages of a user.

\textbf{Impersonate User:} opens another browser window which allows you
to browse the site as if you were the user.

\textbf{Deactivate:} deactivates the user's account.

Note that most users can't perform most of the above actions. In fact,
most users won't even have access to the Control Panel. You can perform
all of the above functions because you have administrative access.

Next, let's look at how to manage organizations.

\subsection{Organizations}\label{organizations}

Organizations are used to represent hierarchical structures of users
such as those of companies, businesses, non-profit organizations,
churches, schools, and clubs. They are designed to allow distributed
user administration. Organizations can be used, for example, to
represent a sports league. The league itself could be modeled as a
top-level organization and the various sports (soccer, baseball,
basketball, etc.) could be modeled as suborganizations. The teams
belonging to the various sports could be modeled as sub-organizations of
the sports organizations. So, for example, you could have an
organization hierarchy that looks like this:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Atlantic Sports League

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Atlantic Soccer Association

    \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
    \item
      Midway Soccer Club
    \item
      Fairview Soccer Club
    \item
      Oak Grove Soccer Club
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Atlantic Baseball Association

    \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
    \item
      Five Points Baseball Club
    \item
      Riverside Baseball Club
    \item
      Pleasant Hill Baseball Club
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Atlantic Basketball Association

    \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
    \item
      Bethel Basketball Club
    \item
      Centerville Basketball Club
    \item
      New Hope Basketball Club
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Whenever you have a collection of users that fit into a hierarchical
structure, you can use organizations to model those users. In Liferay,
organization administrators can manage all the users in their
organization \emph{and} in any suborganization. Referring to the
hierarchy above, for example, an organization administrator of the
Atlantic Sports League could manage any users belonging to the league
itself, to any of the associations, or to any of the associations'
clubs. An organization administrator of the Atlantic Soccer Association
could manage any users belonging to the Atlantic Soccer Association
itself, or to the Midway Soccer Club, Fairview Soccer Club, or Oak Grove
Soccer Club. However, an administrator of the Atlantic Soccer
Association would not be able to manage users belonging to the Atlantic
Baseball Association or to the Bethel Basketball Club.

Organizations and suborganization hierarchies can be created to
unlimited levels. Users can be members of one or many organizations. The
rights of an organization administrator apply both to his/her
organization and to any child organizations. By default, members of
child organizations are implicit members of their parent organizations.
This means, for example, that members of child organizations can access
the private pages of their parent organizations. This behavior can be
customized in your portal's \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} configuration
file.

Since organizations are designed for distributed user administration,
organization administrators have an entirely different set of privileges
than site administrators. Site administrators are responsible for the
pages, portlets, and content of their site. They are also responsible
for managing the membership of their site. To this end, they can set the
membership type to Open, Restricted, or Private. They can also add users
to or remove users from their site but cannot manage the users
themselves. Organization administrators, on the other hand, can edit
users belonging to their organization or any suborganization. They
cannot add existing users to their organization but they can create new
users within their organization. Only portal administrators can add
existing users to an organization.

Many simple portal designs don't use organizations at all; they only use
sites (see chapters 2 and 3 for more information on sites). Remember
that the main purpose of organizations is to allow for distributed user
management. They allow portal administrators to delegate some of their
user management responsibilities to organization administrators. If you
don't anticipate needing to delegate user management responsibilities,
your portal design need not include organizations. In order to decide
whether or not your portal design should include organization, think
about your portal's function. A simple photo-sharing web site, for
example, could be powered by sites only. On the other hand,
organizations are useful for corporations or educational institutions
since their users can easily be placed into a hierarchical structure. In
fact, organizations in Liferay are designed to model any group
hierarchy, from those of government agencies all the way down to those
of small clubs. Of course, users can belong both to organizations and to
independent sites. For example, a corporation or educational institution
could create a social networking site open to all portal users, even
ones from separate organizations.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-add-organization-screen.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.4: Adding a new organization is easy. Once you've
clicked \emph{Save} to create the organization, you can specify
additional details about the organization.}
\end{figure}

Additionally, organization administrators can assign organization-scoped
roles to members of their organization. For example, consider an IT
Security group in a corporate setting. You could have a suborganizaton
of your IT organization that handles security for all of the
applications company-wide. If you grant the IT Security organization the
portal administrator role, all the members of the organization would
have administrative access to the entire portal. Suppose further that a
user in this organization was later hired by the Human Resources
department. The simple act of removing the user from the IT Security
organization also removes the user's administrative privileges, since
the privilege came from the IT Security organization's role. By adding
the user to the HR organization, any roles the HR organization has (such
as access to a benefits system in the portal) are transferred to the
user. In this manner, you can design your portal to correspond with your
existing organization chart and users' permissions are granted according
to their positions in the chart.

Of course, this is only one way to design it. If you have more complex
requirements for permissions within an organization, you can create
custom organization-scoped roles to assemble the permissions you wish to
grant to particular users. Alternatively, you could consider attaching a
site to your organization and using site teams to assemble the sets of
permissions (see below). We'll discuss roles and permissions in more
detail later in this chapter.

Does your organization need to have its own site? Many organizations
don't, but since some do, Liferay allows sites to be attached to
organizations. If an organization has an attached site, the
organization's administrators are treated as the site administrators of
the attached site. This means that they can manage the pages, portlets,
and content of the site as well as the users of the organization.
Members of an organization with an attached site are treated as members
of the organization's site. This means that they can access the private
pages of the organization's site, along with any portlets or content
there. The capability of attaching sites to organizations allows portal
administrators to use organizations to facilitate distributed portal
administration, not just distributed user administration. Next, let's
learn how to create and manage organizations.

To add an organization, click the \emph{Users and Organizations} link in
the Control Panel. Then click the \emph{Add} button and choose
\emph{Regular Organization}. To attach a site when you create an
organization, click on \emph{Organization Site} at the right and check
the \emph{Create Site} box. If you don't know right now if your
organization needs a site, that's fine. You can always add one later if
the need arises.

\textbf{Name:} Enter a name for the organization.

\textbf{Type:} Choose whether this is a regular organization or a
location. A location cannot have any suborganizations.

\textbf{Parent Organization:} Select an organization in the system to be
the direct parent of the organization you are creating. Click the
\emph{Remove} button to remove the currently configured parent.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} By creating an organization, you automatically become both
a member and receive the Organization Owner role, which gives you full
administrative rights within the organization. This means that you can,
for example, appoint other users to be organization administrators or
organization owners. Organization owners are equivalent to organization
administrators except that they can assign the Organization Owner and
Organization Administrator roles to other users; they can also remove
the memberships of other Organization Administrators or Owners.
Organization administrators can't make these role assignments and can't
manage the memberships of other Organization Administrators or Owners.

\end{roundedframe}
Fill out the information for your organization and click \emph{Save}. As
when creating a new user, after you click \emph{Save} to submit the
form, a success message appears along with a new form which lets you
enter additional information about the organization. Organizations can
have multiple email addresses, postal addresses, web sites, and phone
numbers associated with them. The Services link can be used to indicate
the operating hours of the organization, if any.

For now, click on the \emph{Back} icon. This takes you back to the list
of organizations. Click the \emph{Actions} button next to the new
organization you created. This shows a list of actions you can perform
on this organization.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/server-configuration-new-user-group.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.5: When creating a new user group, you can select a
site template for the public or private pages of the user group site. If
you don't select a site template at creation time, you can edit the user
group later to add one.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Edit:} lets you specify details about the organization,
including addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and websites.

\textbf{Manage Site:} lets you create and manage the public and private
pages of the organization's site. This only appears for organizations
that have attached sites.

\textbf{Assign Organization Roles:} lets you assign organization-scoped
roles to users. By default, Organizations are created with three roles:
Organization Administrator, Organization User and Organization Owner.
You can assign one or more of these roles to users in the organization.
All members of the organization automatically get the Organization User
role so this role is hidden when you click Assign Organization Roles.

\textbf{Assign Users:} lets you search and select users in the portal to
be assigned to this organization as members.

\textbf{Add User:} adds a new user in the portal and assigns the user as
a member of this organization.

\textbf{Add Regular Organization:} lets you add a child organization to
this organization. This is how you create hierarchies of organizations
with parent-child relationships.

\textbf{Add Location:} lets you add a child Location, which is a special
type of organization that cannot have any children added to it.

\textbf{Delete:} removes this organization from the portal. Make sure
the organization has no users in it first.

If you click the \emph{View} button at the top of the Users and
Organizations page and select \emph{View Hierarchy} you can view both a
list of users who are members of this organization and a list of all the
suborganizations of this organization.

Users can join or be assigned to sites when they share a common
interest. Users can be assigned to organizations when they fit into a
hierarchical structure. Users groups provide a more ad hoc way to group
users than sites and organizations. Let's look at them next.

\section{User Groups}\label{user-groups}

User Groups are designed to allow portal administrators to create groups
of users that traverse the organizations hierarchy. They can be used to
create arbitrary groupings of users who don't necessarily share an
obvious hierarchical attribute. Users can be assigned to multiple user
groups. For example, consider a software company with many offices and
departments within each office. The company's office/department
structure could be modeled through organizations. In this situation, it
might make sense to create user groups for developers, office managers,
accountant, etc. User Groups are most often used to achieve one of the
following goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To simplify the assignment of several roles to a group of users. For
  example, in a University portal, a user group could be created to
  group all teachers independently of their organizations to make it
  easier to assign one or several roles at once to all the teachers.
\item
  To simplify membership to one or more sites by specifying a group of
  users. Using the previous example, all teachers could be members of
  the sites \emph{University Employees} and \emph{Students and Teachers
  Collaboration Site} by adding the \emph{Teachers} user group as a
  member.
\item
  To provide predefined public or private pages to the users who belong
  to the user group. For example, the \emph{Teachers} user group could
  be created to ensure the home page on all teachers' personal sites has
  the same layout and applications.
\end{itemize}

Creating a user group is easy. Navigate to the Control Panel, click on
the \emph{Users Groups} link and then click on the \emph{Add} button.
There's only one required field: Name. It's usually best to enter a
description as well. Click \emph{Save} and you will be redirected back
to the \emph{User Groups} page of the Control Panel.

Note in the figure above that a user group can have a site, with public
and private pages. A user group site is a special type of site that
determines the base pages of the personal sites of all the user group
members. User group sites work similarly to site templates, except that
user group site pages are not copied for each user. Instead, they are
shown dynamically along with any custom pages that the user may have on
his/her personal site. For this reason, users are not allowed to make
any modifications to the pages that are \emph{inherited} from the user
group. Optionally, the administrators of the user group can define
certain areas as customizable, just like they can for regular sites.
This allows users to decide which applications they want to place in
certain areas of each page, as well as customize the configurations of
the applications.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-editing-a-user-group.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.6: To edit the pages of a user group site, click
\emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Manage Site Pages} next to the user group you'd
like to edit.}
\end{figure}

As with the other resources in the portal, you can click the
\emph{Actions} button next to a user group to perform various operations
on that group.

\textbf{Edit:} allows you to modify the name or description of the user
group.

\textbf{Permissions:} lets you define which roles have permissions to
view, edit, delete, assign members to the user group, etc.

\textbf{Site Permissions:} lets you define which roles have permissions
to manage the user group site, to specify who can administer its pages,
export and import pages and portlet content, manage archived setups and
configure its applications.

\textbf{Manage Site Pages:} allows you to add pages to the user group
site, import or export pages, organize the page hierarchy, modify the
look and feel of the pages, add a logo or access other options from the
Manage Site interface.

\textbf{Assign Members:} lets you search for and select users in the
portal to be assigned to this user group as well as view the users
currently belonging to the user group .

\textbf{Delete:} removes the user group.

If your user group has a site, two options named \emph{Go to the Site's
Public Pages} and \emph{Go to the Site's Private Pages} also appear as
links in your user group's Actions menu. Clicking one of these links
opens the user group's site in a new browser window. Any changes you
make to the site are saved automatically. You can safely close the
browser window when you're done.

\subsection{Creating and Editing a User
Group}\label{creating-and-editing-a-user-group}

A user group's site can be administered from the Control Panel. Click on
\emph{User Groups} from the Control Panel to see a list of existing user
groups. To edit a user group, click on its name or description. You can
also click on the \emph{Actions} button to see the full list of actions
that can be performed on a user group. When editing a user group, you
can view its site, if it exists, by clicking the \emph{Open Pages} link
under Public Pages or Private Pages (read below for details on user
group sites).

As an example of how user group sites can be used, let's create a user
group called \emph{Bloggers} along with a simple site template. We'll
call the site template \emph{Bloggers} too. It should contain a single
\emph{Blog} page with the Blogs and Recents Bloggers portlets on it.
First, navigate to the User Groups page of the Control Panel. Then click
\emph{Add} and enter the name \emph{Bloggers} for your user group, and
optionally, a description. Click \emph{Save} to create your user group.

Our next step is to assign an existing user to the \emph{Bloggers}
group.

\subsection{Assigning Members to a User
Group}\label{assigning-members-to-a-user-group}

Navigate to \emph{Users and Organizations} and create a new user called
\emph{Joe Bloggs}. Then navigate to the User Groups page of the Control
Panel and click \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Assign Members} next to the
Bloggers group. Click the \emph{Available} tab to see a list of users
that can be assigned to the group.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-adding-members-to-user-group.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.7: When assigning members to a user group, click on
the \emph{Available} tab to see a list of users able to be added to the
user group.}
\end{figure}

From this list, one or more users can be assigned as members of the user
group. After the user group has been created and several users have been
added to it, you can add all those users at once as members of a site in
one step from the \emph{Site Memberships} UI of the site. You can also
use the user group when assigning a role to users from the roles
management UI. The next section explains how to use user group sites.

\subsection{User Group Sites}\label{user-group-sites}

Liferay allows users to each have a personal site consisting of public
and private pages. Permissions can be granted to allow users to
customize their personal sites at will. Originally, the default
configuration of those pages could only be determined by the portal
administrator through the \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file and,
optionally, by providing the configuration in a LAR file. You can still
configure it like this but it isn't very flexible or easy to use.

By using User Group Sites, portal administrators can add pages to the
personal sites of all the users who belong to the site in an easy and
centralized way. All the user group site's public pages are shown as
part of the user's public personal site. All the user group site's
private pages are shown as part of the user's private site. If a user
belongs to several user groups, all of its pages are made part of his
public and private site. In an educational institution's portal, for
example, teachers, staff and students could get different default pages
and applications on their personal sites.

The pages a user's personal site \emph{inherits} from a User Group still
belong to the User Group and thus cannot be changed in any way by the
user. What the user group administrators can do is define certain areas
of the pages as customizable to allow the users to choose which
applications and what configuration should be shown in those areas. If a
user has permission to add custom pages to his/her personal site,
besides those \emph{inherited} from a user group, the custom pages are
always shown last.

Since the \emph{inheritance} of pages is done dynamically, this system,
which was introduced in Liferay 6.1, can scale to hundreds of thousands
of users or even millions of them without an exponential impact in
performance. Previous versions of Liferay used a different technique
that required user group pages be copied to each user's personal site.
For portals upgrading from previous versions of Liferay, you can keep
the old behavior but it has been left disabled by default. You can
enable it by adding the following line to your portal-ext.properties
file:

\begin{verbatim}
user.groups.copy.layouts.to.user.personal.site=true
\end{verbatim}

When this property is set to true, once the template pages have been
copied to a user's personal site, the copies may be modified by the
user. Changes done to the originals in the User Group will only affect
new users added to the user group. Users with administrative privileges
over their personal sites can modify the pages and their content if the
\emph{Allow Site Administrators to Modify the Pages Associated with This
Site Template} box has been checked for the template. When a user is
removed from a user group, the associated pages are removed from the
user's personal site. Moreover, if a user is removed from a group and is
subsequently added back, the group's template pages are copied to the
user's site a second time. Note that if a user group's site is based on
a site template and an administrator modifies the user group's site
template after users have already been added to the group, those changes
only take effect if the \emph{Enable propagation of changes from the
site template} box for the user group was checked.

\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} Prior to Liferay 6.1, pages from different user groups
could be combined on users' personal sites by using a naming convention.
Liferay 6.1 simplifies the way user groups' sites work by disallowing
page combination. Set the property
\emph{user.groups.copy.layouts.to.user.personal.site} to true if you
want to preserve the page combination functionality.

\end{roundedframe}
You can create a user group's site manually or base it on a site
template. To create a user group's site manually, use the \emph{Actions}
menu mentioned above and choose \emph{Manage Site Pages}. You can add a
new public or private page by selecting the appropriate tab and then
clicking the \emph{Add Page} button. Once the user group has at least
one public or private page in place, you can go back to the
\emph{Actions} menu and click on the \emph{Go to the Site's Public
Pages} or \emph{Go to the Site's Private Pages} link to open the user
group's site in a new browser window. In the new window, you can add
more pages and portlets and configure site settings.

You can also base a user group's site on a template. When editing a user
group, use the Public Pages and Private Pages drop down lists to select
a site template. Leave the \emph{Enable propagation of changes from the
site template} box checked to automatically update users' personal sites
if the associated site template changes. If you uncheck this box but
recheck it later, the template pages are copied to the users' sites,
overwriting any changes they may have made. You can allow users to make
changes to the pages they receive from the user group by enabling the
customization options on each page.

This flexibility lets you achieve almost any desired configuration for a
user's personal site without having to modify it directly. When a user
is assigned to a user group, the configured site pages are copied
directly to the user's personal site.

Continuing with the example above, we will create a site for our sample
user group. Edit the \emph{Bloggers} user group. Choose an existing Site
Template from the drop down menu for the user group's public pages and
click \emph{Save}. After the page reloads you can click to see the pages
and make any changes desired, add additional pages, etc.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/server-configuration-new-user-group.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.8: You can select a site template to apply to a user
group's public or private pages if the public or private page set is
empty. If pages have already been added to the page set, you'll have to
remove them before you can apply a site template the page.}
\end{figure}

Also, try visiting the public site of one of the users who belongs to
the user group. You'll see that all of the pages in the user group
appear as part of the user site, including ones copied from the site
template and ones added afterwards.

\section{Roles and Permissions}\label{roles-and-permissions}

Roles are used to collect permissions that define a particular function
within the portal, according to a particular scope. Roles can be granted
permissions to various functions within portlet applications. A roles is
basically just a collection of permissions that defines a function, such
as Message Board Administrator. A role with that name is likely to have
permissions relevant to the specific Message Board portlets delegated to
it. Users who are placed in this role will inherit these permissions.

If you navigate to the Control Panel and click on \emph{Roles}, you'll
find a single interface which lets you create roles, assign permissions
to them, and assign users to the roles. Roles can be scoped by portal,
site, or organization. To create a role, click the \emph{Roles} link and
then click the \emph{Add} button. You can choose a Regular, Site or
Organization role. A regular role is a portal-scoped role. Make a
selection and then type a name for your role, a title and a description.
The name field is required but the title and description are optional.
If you enter a name and a title, the title will be displayed in the list
of roles on the Roles page of the Control Panel. If you do not enter a
title, the name will be displayed. When you have finished, click
\emph{Save}.

In addition to regular roles, site roles, and organization roles, there
are also teams. Teams can be created by site administrators within a
specific site. The permissions granted to a team are defined and applied
only within the team's site. The permissions defined by regular, site,
and organization roles, by contrast, are defined at the portal level,
although they are applied to different scopes. The differences between
the four types of roles can be described as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Regular role: Permissions are defined at the \emph{portal} level and
  are applied at the \emph{portal} level.
\item
  Site role: Permissions are defined at the \emph{portal} level and are
  applied to one \emph{specific site}.
\item
  Organization role: Permissions are defined at the \emph{portal} level
  and are applied to one \emph{specific organization}.
\item
  Team: Permissions are defined within a \emph{specific site} and are
  assigned within that \emph{specific site}.
\end{itemize}

For more information about teams, please refer to chapter 3.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-roles-and-role-actions.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.9: To examine all the roles defined for your portal,
navigate to the Control Panel and click on \emph{Roles}.}
\end{figure}

After you save, Liferay redirects you to the list of roles. To see what
functions you can perform on your new role, click the \emph{Actions}
button.

\textbf{Edit:} lets you change the name, title or description of the
role.

\textbf{Permissions:} allows you to define which users, user groups or
roles have permissions to edit the role.

\textbf{Define Permissions:} defines what permissions this role grants.
This is outlined in the next section.

\textbf{Assign Members:} lets you search and select users in the portal
to be assigned to this role. These users will inherit any permissions
that have been assigned to this role.

\textbf{View Users:} allows you to view the users who have been assigned
to this role.

\textbf{Delete:} permanently removes a role from the portal.

Next, let's learn about the difference between the
(portal/site/organization) administrator and owner roles that Liferay
provides out-of-the-box.

\subsection{Out-of-the-box Liferay
Roles}\label{out-of-the-box-liferay-roles}

If you navigate to the Control Panel and click on \emph{Roles}, you'll
see a list of all the roles that have been created in your portal. This
list includes roles that Liferay provides out-of-the-box and any
additional custom roles. These are some of Liferay's out-of-the-box
roles:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Guest: The Guest role is assigned to unauthenticated users and grants
  the lowest-level permissions within the portal.
\item
  User: The User role is assigned to authenticated users and grants
  basic basic permissions within the portal.
\item
  Power User: By default, the Power User role grants the same
  permissions as the User role. It's designed to be an extension point
  for distinguishing regular users from more privileged users. For
  example, you can set up your portal so that only Power Users have
  personal sites.
\item
  Site Member: The Site Member role grants basic privileges within a
  site, such as the ability to visit the site's private pages.
\item
  Site Administrator: The Site Administrator role grants the ability to
  manage \emph{almost} all aspects of a site including site content,
  site memberships, and site settings. Site Administrators cannot delete
  the membership of or remove roles from other Site Administrators or
  Site Owners. They also \emph{cannot} assign other users as Site
  Administrators or Site Owners.
\item
  Site Owner: The Site Owner role is the same as the Site Administrator
  role except that it grants the ability to manage \emph{all} aspects of
  a site, including the ability to delete the membership of or remove
  roles from Site Administrators or other Site Owners. They \emph{can}
  assign other users as Site Administrators or Site Owners.
\item
  Organization User: The Organization User role grants basic privileges
  within an organization. If the organization has an attached site, the
  Organization User role implicitly grants the Site member role within
  the attached site.
\item
  Organization Administrator: The Organization Administrator role grants
  the ability to manage \emph{almost} all aspects of an organization
  including the organization's users and the organization's site (if it
  exists). Organization Administrators cannot delete the membership of
  or remove roles from other Organization Administrators or Organization
  Owners. They also \emph{cannot} assign other users as Organization
  Administrators or Organization Owners.
\item
  Organization Owner: The Organization Owner role is the same as the
  Organization Administrator role except that it grants the ability to
  manage \emph{all} aspects of an organization, including the ability to
  delete the membership of or remove roles from Organization
  Administrators or other Organization Owners. They \emph{can} assign
  other users as Organization Administrators or Organization Owners.
\item
  Administrator: The administrator role grants the ability to manage the
  entire portal, including global portal settings and individual sites,
  organizations, and users.
\end{itemize}

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} It's easy to overlook the differences between site and
organization owners and site and organization administrators. Remember
that site and organization administrators \emph{cannot} delete the
membership of or remove the administrator or owner role from any other
administrator or owner. They also \emph{cannot} appoint other users as
site or organization administrators or owners. Site and organization
owners \emph{can} delete the membership of or remove the administrator
or owner roles from other site or organization administrators. They
\emph{can} appoint other users as site or organization administrators or
owners.

\end{roundedframe}
Next, let's examine how to configure the permissions granted by
different roles.

\subsection{Defining Permissions on a
Role}\label{defining-permissions-on-a-role}

Roles serve as repositories of permissions. When a roles is assigned to
a user, the user receives all the permissions defined by the role. So,
to use a role, you need to assign members to it and define the
permissions you want to grant to members of the role.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-defining-permissions-on-a-role.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.10: When defining permissions on a role, the Summary
view provides a list of permissions that have already been defined for
the role. The area on the left side of the screen lets you drill down
through various categories of portal permissions.}
\end{figure}

When you click on the \emph{Actions} button for a portal-scoped role and
select \emph{Define Permissions}, you'll see a list of all the
permissions that have been defined for that role. To add permissions to
a role, drill down through the categories of permissions on the left
side of the screen and click on a specific category (such as \emph{Site
Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Pages} $\rightarrow$\emph{Site Pages}. In the center of the
screen, you'll see the permissions that belong to that category. Flag
the checkboxes next to the permissions that you'd like to add the role,
then click \emph{Save}. For non-portal scoped roles, you need to click
on the \emph{Options} link on individual portlets, then
\emph{Configuration}, then \emph{Permissions} to assign permissions
within the site that owns the portlet.

Portal permissions cover portal-wide activities that comprise several
categories, such as site, organization, location, password policy, etc.
This allows you to create a role that, for example, can create new sites
within the portal. This would allow you to grant users that particular
permission without making them overall portal administrators.

For Liferay 6.2, the permissions fall into the following hierarchy of
categories:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt

  \begin{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Account Settings
  \item
    My Pages
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The three basic categories of permissions are Control Panel, Site
Administration, and My Account. By default, any portal user can manage
their user account via the permissions belonging to the My Account
category. Site administrators can access the site administration tools
belonging to the Site Administration category. And portal administrators
can access the entire Control Panel. For custom roles, you can mix and
match permissions from as many categories as you like.

The permissions in the Site Administration \&rrar; Applications
categories govern the content that can be created by core portlets such
as the Wiki and Message Boards. If you pick one of the portlets from
this list, you'll get options for defining permissions on its content.
For example, if you pick Message Boards, you'll see permissions for
creating categories and threads or deleting and moving topics.

Site application permissions affect the application as a whole. So,
using the Message Boards as an example, an application permission might
define who can add the Message Boards portlet to a page.

The Control Panel permissions affect how the Control Panel appears to
the user in the Control Panel. The Control Panel appears differently to
different users, depending on their permissions. Some Control Panel
portlets have a Configuration button and you can define who gets to see
that. You can also fine-tune who gets to see various applications in the
Control Panel.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-message-board-content-permissions.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.11: You can fine-tune which actions are defined for a
role within a specific application like the Message Boards.}
\end{figure}

Each possible action to which permissions can be granted is listed. To
grant a permission, flag the checkbox next to it. If you want to change
the scope of a permission, click the \emph{Change} link next to the gear
icon next to the permission and then choose a new scope. After you
finish defining permissions for a role, click \emph{Save}. For a
portal-scoped Message Boards Administrator role, you might want to grant
content permissions for every Message Boards action listed. After you
click \emph{Save}, you'll see a list of all permissions currently
granted to the role. From the Summary view, you can add more permissions
or go back by clicking on the \emph{Back} icon.

The list of permissions that you can define for a role may seem
overwhelming. However, these permissions ensure that you can customize
exactly which areas of your portal you'd like different collections of
users to be able to access. Sometimes you might find that a certain
permission grants more or less access than what you expected--always
test your permissions configurations!

For example, suppose that you need to create a role called User Group
Manager. You'd like to define the permissions for the User Group Manager
role so that users assigned to this role can add users to or remove
users from any user group. To do this, you can take the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Click on \emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Control Panel} from the Dockbar and then
  click on \emph{Roles}.
\item
  On the Roles screen, click \emph{Add} $\rightarrow$\emph{Regular Role}.
\item
  After naming your role and entering a title, click \emph{Save}.
\item
  Click on \emph{Define Permissions} and drill down in the menu on the
  left to \emph{Control Panel} $\rightarrow$\emph{Users} $\rightarrow$\emph{Users and
  Organizations}.
\item
  Under the \emph{General Permissions} heading, flag \emph{Access in
  Control Panel} and \emph{View}. This lets user group managers access
  the User Groups Control Panel portlet and view existing user groups.
\item
  Since you'd like user group managers to be able to view user groups
  and assign members to them, you'd also check the \emph{Assign Members}
  and \emph{View} permissions under the \emph{Resource Permissions} →
  \emph{User Group} heading.
\item
  Click \emph{Save}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/user-group-manager-role.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.12: Make sure to test the permissions you grant to
custom roles.}
\end{figure}

You might expect that these permissions would be enough to allow users
assigned to the User Group Manager role to add or remove any users to or
from any user group. After all, we've granted user group managers
permissions to view user groups and assign members and we've granted
them access to User Groups in the Control Panel. However, we're
forgetting an important permission. Can you guess what it is? That's
right: we haven't granted the User Group Manager role permission to view
users! Although user group managers can assign members to user groups,
they don't have permission to view users at the portal level. This means
that if they click \emph{Assign Members} for a user group and click on
the \emph{Available} tab, they'll see an empty list.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/no-users-found.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.13: Users assigned to the User Group Manager role
can't find any users to add!}
\end{figure}

To fix this, log in as an administrator and click \emph{Admin} →
\emph{Control Panel} from the Dockbar. Then click on \emph{Roles} and
then on \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Define Permissions} next to the
\emph{User Group Manager} role. Then, drill down to the \emph{Control
Panel} $\rightarrow$\emph{Users} $\rightarrow$\emph{Users and Organizations} category and flag
the \emph{View} permission under the \emph{Resource Permissions} \&rrar;
\emph{User} heading. \emph{View}. Click \emph{Save}. Once you've saved
your permissions configuration, users who've been assigned to the User
Group Manager role will be able to browse the portal's entire list of
users when assigning users to a user group.

Roles are very powerful and allow portal administrators to define
various permissions in whatever combinations they like. This gives you
as much flexibility as possible to build the site you have designed.

\subsection{Permission for Delegating Social Activities
Configuration}\label{permission-for-delegating-social-activities-configuration}

As of Liferay 6.2, there's a permission that allows site administrators
to delegate responsibility for configuring social activities to other
users. To assign this permission to a role, first navigate to the
Control Panel and click on \emph{Roles}. If you'd like to add a new
role, do so. Then click \emph{Actions} next to the role to which you'd
like to add social activities configuration permissions and select
\emph{Define Permissions}. Next, drill down to the \emph{Site
Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Configuration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Social Activity}
permissions category. Flag all of the permissions and then click
\emph{Save}:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Access in Site Administration
\item
  Configuration
\item
  Permissions
\item
  View
\end{itemize}

Once these permissions have been assigned to the chosen role, any users
assigned to the role will be able to manage your site's Social
Activities configuration.

\subsection{Note About Permissions for Deleting
Containers}\label{note-about-permissions-for-deleting-containers}

Liferay Portal contains many types of portal resources upon which
permissions can be defined. These include both assets and asset
containers. The term \emph{asset} refers to any kind of content in
Liferay such as a web content article, blog entry, wiki article, message
board post, or Documents and Media document. Asset containers are portal
resources used for grouping specific kinds of assets. For example, web
content folders, wiki nodes, message board categories, and Documents and
Media folders are asset containers.

When configuring permissions for assets and asset containers, it's
important to note that the permission to delete an asset container
includes the permission to indirectly delete any assets in the
container. This means that if a user has permission to delete an asset
container, the user can delete all of the assets in that container even
the user lacks permission to delete any of the assets in the container
individually. Granting permission to delete a folder but not any of the
contained assets is \emph{not} a common use case. Nevertheless, it's
important to note that assets in a container can be indirectly deleted
if their asset container is deleted.

\subsection{Note About the Power Users
Role}\label{note-about-the-power-users-role}

Prior to Liferay 6.0, the default configurations of many Liferay
portlets allowed power users, but not regular users, to access them.
Liferay 6.0 and subsequent versions grant the same default permissions
to both power users and regular users. This way, portal administrators
are not forced to use the power users role. However, Liferay encourages
those who do to create their own custom permissions for the role.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Note: Prior to Liferay version 6.0, Power Users and Users did \emph{not}
have the same default permissions. So if are using Liferay 5.2 or a
previous version, it's dangerous to remove the Power Users role from the
default user associations: this could remove certain permissions you
expect to apply to all users. If you decide to remove the Power Users
role from the default user associations anyway, you will probably want
to modify the permissions on certain portlets to make them accessible to
all users. To do this, see the section on Plugins Configuration below.

\end{roundedframe}
Now that we've seen how to use organizations and user groups to manage
users and how to use roles to define permissions, let's learn how to
configure portal password policies.

\subsection{Password Policies}\label{password-policies}

Password policies can enhance the security of your portal. You can set
requirements on password strength, frequency of password expiration,
user lockout, and more. Additionally, you can apply different password
policies to different sets of portal users. You define custom password
policies or delegate user authentication to an LDAP server.

If you are viewing a page other than the Control Panel, click on
\emph{Admin} $\rightarrow$\emph{Control Panel} from the Dockbar. Next, click on the
\emph{Password Policies} link under the \emph{Users} heading. You'll see
that there's already a default password policy in the system. You can
edit this in the same manner as you edit other resources in the portal:
click \emph{Actions} and then click \emph{Edit}.

The Password Policy settings form contains the following fields.
Enabling specific settings via the check boxes prompts setting-specific
options to appear.

\textbf{Name:} requires you to enter a name for the password policy.

\textbf{Description:} lets you describe the password policy so other
administrators will know what it's for.

\textbf{Changeable:} determines whether or not a user can change his or
her password.

\textbf{Change Required:} determines whether or not a user must change
his or her password after logging into the portal for the first time.

\textbf{Minimum Age:} lets you choose how long a password must remain in
effect before it can be changed.

\textbf{Reset Ticket Max Age:} determines how long a password reset link
remains valid.

\textbf{Password Syntax Checking:} allows you to set a minimum password
length and to choose whether or not dictionary words can be in
passwords. You can also specify detailed requirements such as minimum
numbers of alpha numeric characters, lower case letters, upper case
letters, numbers or symbols.

\textbf{Password History:} lets you keep a history (with a defined
length) of passwords and prevents users from changing their passwords to
one that was previously used.

\textbf{Password Expiration:} lets you choose how long passwords can
remain active before they expire. You can select the age, the warning
time and a grace limit.

\textbf{Lockout:} allows you to set a number of failed log-in attempts
that triggers a user's account to lock. You can choose whether an
administrator needs to unlock the account or if it becomes unlocked
after a specific duration.

From the list of password policies, you can perform several other
actions.

\textbf{Edit:} brings you to the form above and allows you to modify the
password policy.

\textbf{Permissions:} allows you to define which users, user groups or
roles have permission to edit the password policy.

\textbf{Assign Members:} takes you to a screen where you can search and
select users in the portal to be assigned to this password policy. The
password policy will be enforced for any users who are added here.

\textbf{Delete:} shows up for any password policies you add beyond the
default policy. You cannot delete the default policy.

\section{Monitoring}\label{monitoring}

The last link in the Users section of the Control Panel is for
monitoring. You can use the Monitoring page to view all of the live
sessions in the portal. For performance reasons, this setting is usually
turned off in production.

Another way of seeing what users are doing is to install the Audit
plugin from \href{https://www.liferay.com/marketplace}{Liferay
Marketplace}. You'll learn how to use that next.

\section{Audit Trails}\label{audit-trails}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.25\textwidth}

\scalegraphics{../../images/ee-feature-web.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

You've just finished lunch and are ready to get back to work. You have a
site in Liferay you use to manage your project, and before you left, you
were about to create a folder in your Documents and Media library for
sharing some requirements documentation. Sitting down at your desk, you
navigate to the repository and attempt to create the folder.

\emph{You do not have permission to perform this action}, Liferay
helpfully tells you.

``\emph{What?}'' you blurt accidentally in surprise. ``This is \emph{my}
project!''

``Ah, you too?'' asks a co-worker helpfully from over the cube wall. ``I
lost access to a wiki I was updating just a few minutes ago. I was about
to enter a support ticket for it.''

``Forget the ticket. Let's go see the portal admin now,'' you say.

And off you go, two floors down, to the far end of the building where,
as you approach, you can already hear stress in the portal admin's voice
as he tries to reassure someone on the phone.

``Yes, Mr.~Jones. Yes, I'll fix it.'' (\emph{Jones? The president of the
company?} goes through your mind.) ``I'll get on it right away,
Mr.~Jones. It was just a mistake; I'll fix it. Thank you, Mr.~Jones,''
and he hangs up the phone.

``Problems?'' you ask the portal admin, whose name is Harry. He does
look rather harried.

``Yeah, Tom,'' he says. ``Somebody changed a bunch of permissions in the
portal---it wasn't me. I'm assuming you and Dick are here because of the
same problem?''

``Yup,'' you say. ``I lost access to a document repository folder.''

``And I lost access to a wiki,'' Dick says helpfully.

``It was probably due to some site membership change. Let's take a look
at the audit portlet in the control panel and see what happened.''

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary to see what
users are doing on your portal, you'll find Liferay makes this easy. If
you're a Liferay Enterprise Edition customer, you have access to two
plugins--a hook and a portlet--that, in combination with some settings
in \texttt{portal-ext.properties}, enable you to see all the activity
that occurs in your portal. Using this, you can quickly find out what
changes were made and by whom. If you've delegated permission granting
to any group of people, this is an essential feature you're likely to
use.

We'll come back to Tom, Dick and Harry's story later in the chapter. For
now, let's look at how to install Liferay's audit plugins so you can do
the same thing Harry's about to do.

\subsection{Installing and Configuring the Audit
Plugins}\label{installing-and-configuring-the-audit-plugins}

Liferay's audit functionality is composed of two parts: a back-end piece
that hooks into Liferay events and a front-end piece that gives you an
interface to see what's happening. Both of these plugins are included in
the Audit EE app which is available on Liferay Marketplace. Please refer
to this guide's chapter on
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/leveraging-the-liferay-marketplace}{Leveraging
the Liferay Marketplace} for information on installing plugins.

Once installed, you can set two properties in your
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file to tweak the default settings.

\textbf{com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.audit.AuditFilter:} By
default, this is set to \texttt{false}, because the audit plugins aren't
installed by default. When you set it to \texttt{true}, the audit hook
is able to capture more information about events, such as the client
host and the client's IP address.

\textbf{audit.message.com.liferay.portal.model.Layout.VIEW:} In
Liferay's code, pages are referred to as \emph{layouts}. Setting this to
\texttt{true}, therefore, records audit events for page views. It's
turned off by default because this may be too fine-grained for most
installations.

Once you've decided if you're going to use one or both of the two
settings above, place them in your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file
and restart your Liferay server. Once it comes up, audit events are
captured by Liferay, and you'll be able to use them to see what's
happening in your portal.

\subsection{Using Audit Events}\label{using-audit-events}

Now that you're capturing audit events, it's easy to use them to view
activities in your portal. Navigate to the Control Panel and you'll find
a new entry in the Configuration section called \emph{Audit Reports}
(see the figure below).

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.25\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/control-panel-audit-reports.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.14: Once the Audit EE app has been installed, an
Audit Reports entry appears in the Control Panel.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Clicking on \emph{Audit Reports} shows you a list of the events Liferay
has already captured (see the figure beblow), along with an interface
for searching for events. You can browse the list but you'll likely need
to use the search to find what you're looking for.

The figure above shows that Joe Bloggs logged in and performed some
actions on the site. To view details about any of these events, all you
need to do is click on an entry. You'll then see something like the
figure below.

As you can see, depending on how many users you have in your portal,
this list can get populated very quickly. For this reason, it's a good
idea to keep the
\texttt{au\-dit.mes\-sage.com.life\-ray.por\-tal.mo\-del.Lay\-out.VIEW} property set
to \texttt{false}. This way, you don't clutter up your audit events with
multiple page view events, which will definitely be the most often
triggered event in your portal.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/audit-list-events.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.15: Liferay captures and stores events as soon as the
Audit EE app has been installed.}
\end{figure}

Now that you know how to browse and view audit events, let's learn how
to search for specific events.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/audit-detail.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.16: Clicking an event in the list shows the details
of that event. This event shows that Joe Bloggs updated his user
account. Specifically, it shows that he updated his \texttt{prefixId}
from \texttt{0} to \texttt{11015}. The \texttt{prefixId} value
represents a prefix for a real name like ``Dr.'', ``Mr.'', ``Mrs.'', or
``Ms.''}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Viewing Audit Reports}\label{viewing-audit-reports}

Finding what you want in a big list of events is, to use the expression,
like searching for a needle in a haystack. This is why the audit portlet
provides a robust searching mechanism. By default, it looks pretty
simple: there's only a single field for searching. Clicking the
\emph{gear} icon next to the search bar, however, reveals an advanced
search dialog broken out by various fields you can use in your search.

Let's look at the options we have for search.

\textbf{Match:} You can search for matches to \emph{all} the fields
you've specified or \emph{any} single field.

\textbf{User ID:} Specify the user ID you'd like to search for. This
would be the user who performed some action in the portal you'd like to
audit.

\textbf{User Name:} Specify the user name you'd like to search for. This
is often easier than searching for a user ID, especially if you don't
have access to the Liferay database to find the user ID.

\textbf{Resource ID:} Specify the ID of the resource that was modified
or viewed in this audit record.

\textbf{Resource Name:} Specify the name of the resource that was
modified or viewed in this audit record. For example, you could search
for User resources to see if someone modified a user's account.

\textbf{Resource Action:} Specify an action that was performed on the
resource. This could be any one of the following: \texttt{add},
\texttt{assign}, \texttt{delete}, \texttt{impersonate}, \texttt{login},
\texttt{login\_failure}, \texttt{logout}, \texttt{unassign}, or
\texttt{update}.

\textbf{Session ID:} Specify the session ID to search for. You'd use
this if you were correlating a session ID from your web server logs with
activity in Liferay.

\textbf{Client IP:} Specify the IP address of the client that performed
the activity you wish to audit.

\textbf{Client Host:} Specify the host name of the client that performed
the activity you wish to audit.

\textbf{Server Name:} Specify the server name upon which the activity
occurred. If you're using a cluster, each member of the cluster can be
individually queried.

\textbf{Server Port:} Specify the server port upon which the activity
occurred. You'd need this if you run a ``vertical'' cluster of multiple
VMs on the same machine.

\textbf{Start Date:} Specify the low end of the date range you wish to
search.

\textbf{End Date:} Specify the high end of the date range you wish to
search.

Using this form, if you wanted to check to see if someone in the portal
unassigned a user from a particular role, you might search for a
resource name of \emph{user} and a resource action of \emph{unassign}.
The results of such a search might look something like the figure below.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/audit-unassign-search.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.17: Searching for audit events is easy with the
advanced search form provided by the audit portlet. You can specify
various search criteria to find the types of events you're looking for.}
\end{figure}

Once you have the results of your search, you can click on any of the
records returned to see the detail page for that record. The figure
below shows, in this case, that the default administrative user removed
the Power User role from Joe Bloggs.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/audit-unassign-detail.png}
\caption{\\Figure 16.18: If you've delegated portal administration to
multiple users, you can use the audit plugins to determine who made what
change. And, of course, you'll never leave the default administrative
user enabled on a production system, right?}
\end{figure}

As you can see, Liferay's audit portlets give you a lot of power to see
what's happening in your portal. You can use this information to
troubleshoot problems, determine ownership of particular actions, or, as
Harry is about to do, find out who made permission changes they weren't
supposed to make.

\subsection{Conclusion of the Story}\label{conclusion-of-the-story}

``Okay,'' says Harry, ``let's fire up Liferay's audit system and see if
we can figure out what happened.''

You and Dick stand behind Harry's chair and watch as he enters a query
into a form on the audit portlet. Clicking \emph{search}, the screen
fills up with audit events.

``Wow, that's a lot of unassign events.'' Harry says. ``And look who the
culprit is,'' he adds sarcastically.

``Who's Melvin Dooitrong?'' Dick asks.

``That's my new intern,'' Harry says. ``I'm gonna kill him.'' Harry
pushes out his chair and walks down the row of cubes to the end, where a
kid no more than 20 years old with disheveled hair sits, earbuds in his
ears.

``Hey Melvin,'' Harry says as Melvin turns around to face him. ``Didn't
I ask you to move that set of users from site membership to organization
membership?''

``Yeah,'' Melvin says, ``I did that already.''

``How'd you do it?''

``It was going to take a while to do it manually, so I wrote a script
and executed it in the scripting host,'' Melvin replies,
matter-of-factly.

``You did, did you? Well, guess what? Your script removed
\emph{everybody} from \emph{all} sites.''

``\emph{What?}''

``Yeah, and now you're going to start adding them back, one by one,
manually, starting with Mr.~Jones\ldots{}.''

Tom and Dick back away slowly from Melvin's cube as Harry and Melvin
continue to have their--let's call it a discussion. One thing is clear:
they're having a better day than Melvin is.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-16}

In this chapter, we learned how to manage users, organizations, user
groups, and roles via Liferay's Control Panel. Site memberships and
teams aren't the only way for portal administrators to group and manage
users: organizations can be used to arrange users into hierarchical
structures and user groups are a flexible way to collect groups of users
that transcend organizational hierarchies. You can create roles to
define permissions and scope them for the entire portal or for a
particular site or organization. User groups can be assigned to roles;
in this case, each member of the user group is assigned to the role. We
also looked at how to configure password policies for users and how to
view audit trails of what your users are doing in the portal. We'll
continue our coverage of Liferay's Control Panel next, where we'll
examine configurable portal and server settings.

\chapter{Using the Control Panel}\label{using-the-control-panel}

In the previous chapter, we learned how to use the Control Panel for
user management. We learned how to manage users, organizations, user
group, roles, and password policies. We also learned about user
monitoring. In this chapter, we'll look at portal and server
configuration options for Liferay. Now that you have been navigating in
the Control Panel, you should be pretty familiar with how it works. The
Control Panel is organized in four main areas: Users, Sites, Apps, and
Configuration. The options in the \emph{Configuration} section of the
Control Panel category include configuration options which control how
the portal operates and integrates with other systems you may have. In
this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Portal settings, such as user authentication options, mail host names,
  email notifications, identification settings, and display settings
\item
  Custom fields
\item
  Server administration options, including options for resources, log
  levels, properties, CAPTCHA, data migration, file uploads, mail,
  external services, scripts, and shutdown settings
\item
  Portal instances
\end{itemize}

After you have created users, user groups, organizations, roles, sites,
and teams your portal will be ready to host content and applications.
You can configure Liferay's portal settings to fit your environment and
your particular portal project. It's easy to adjust configuration
settings using the portlet-driven user interface of Liferay' Control
Panel. Let's start by examining Liferay's Portal Settings.

\section{Configuring Portal Settings}\label{configuring-portal-settings}

Most global portal settings can be configured from the Portal Settings
section of the Control Panel. The Configuration heading contains the
following links:

\textbf{General:} lets you configure global settings, such as the
company name, domain, the virtual host, a global portal logo, and more.

\textbf{Authentication:} allows you to configure user authentication
methods and connections to LDAP and Single Sign-On servers.

\textbf{Users:} has three tabs labeled Fields, Reserved Credentials and
Default User Associations. The Fields tab enables or disables some user
fields, such as birthday or terms of use. The Reserved Credentials tab
lets you reserve screen names and email addresses so users cannot
register using them. You might use this to prevent users from
registering on the portal with user names that contain profanity or that
sound official, such as \emph{admin} or \emph{president}. The Default
User Associations tab lets you configure default membership to roles,
user groups, sites for new users and provides a check box which allows
you to retroactively apply these to existing users.

\textbf{Mail Host Names:} lets you add a list of other mail host names
to be associated with your organization. For example, your main domain
might be \texttt{mycompany.com} but you might use
\texttt{mycompany-marketing.com} for your email newsletters. Any domain
names associated with your organization can go here.

\textbf{Email Notifications:} allows you to configure Liferay to send
email notifications for certain events, such as user registrations,
password changes, etc. You can customize those messages here.

\textbf{Content Sharing}: contains options for enabling site
administrators to display content in one site from other sites they
administer. You can also configure rules for whether subsites should be
able to display content from their parent sites.

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{../../images/server-configuration-portal-settings-pages.png}
\caption{\\Figure 17.1: After clicking on \emph{Portal Settings} in
Liferay's Control Panel, you can configure any of the areas shown in
this figure.}
\vspace{-12pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

Let's discuss these settings in more detail.

\subsection{General}\label{general-1}

The General link takes you to a screen with three headings: Main
Configuration, Navigation, and Additional Information. Under the Main
Configuration heading, you can set the name of the company or
organization that's responsible for running the portal. This name also
defines the name of your portal's default site. Its default name is
\texttt{liferay.com} so you will definitely want to change this to
reflect the name of your company or organization. You can also set the
mail domain, virtual host and content delivery network address here.

Under the Navigation heading, you can set a home page for your portal
here as well as default landing and logout pages. For setting these
pages, just use the part of the page's address that follows your domain.
For example, if you want the default landing page to be
\texttt{http://local\-host:8080/web/\-guest/log\-in}, use
\texttt{/web/guest/login}. You can also use the variables
\texttt{\$\{life\-ray:screen\-Name\}} and \texttt{\$\{life\-ray:u\-ser\-Id\}} as
part of the address. This comes in handy if you want to redirect users
to their personal pages upon login. Alternatively, you can set the
default login or logout page in a \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file
with the properties \texttt{de\-fault.land\-ing.page.path} and
\texttt{de\-fault.log\-out.page.path}, respectively. For more information,
see the \texttt{por\-tal.pro\-per\-ties} documentation entries for the
\href{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html\#Default\%20Landing\%20Page}{Default
Landing Page} and
\href{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html\#Default\%20Logout\%20Page}{Default
Logout Page}.

Under the Additional Information heading, you can specify a Legal name,
ID, company type, SIC code, ticker symbol, industry and industry type.

\subsection{Authentication}\label{authentication}

The Authentication page has several tabs: General, LDAP, CAS, Facebook,
NTLM, OpenID, Open SSO and SiteMinder. You can use any of these
authentication methods to configure how users will authenticate to
Liferay. Since Liferay supports quite a few authentication methods,
there are different settings for each.

The settings on the General tab of the Authentication page affect only
Liferay functionality and don't have anything to do with the integration
options on the other tabs. The General tab allows you to customize
Liferay's standard authentication behavior. Specifically, the General
tab allows you to select from several global authentication settings:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Authenticate via email address (default), screen name, or user ID (a
  numerical ID auto-generated in the database--not recommended).
\item
  Enable/Disable automatic log in. If enabled, Liferay allows a user to
  check a box which will cause the site to ``remember'' the user's log
  in by placing a cookie on his or her browser. If disabled, users will
  always have to log in manually.
\item
  Enable/Disable forgotten password functionality.
\item
  Enable/Disable request password reset links.
\item
  Enable/Disable account creation by strangers. If you are running an
  Internet site, you will probably want to leave this on so visitors can
  create accounts on your site.
\item
  Enable/Disable account creation by those using an email address in the
  domain of the company running the site (which you just set on the
  General page of Portal Settings). This is handy if you are using
  Liferay to host both internal and external web sites. You can make
  sure all internal IDs have to be created by administrators but
  external users can register for IDs themselves.
\item
  Enable / Disable email address verification. If you enable this,
  Liferay will send users a verification email with a link back to the
  portal to verify the email address they entered is a valid one they
  can access.
\end{itemize}

By default, all settings except for the last are enabled. User
authentication by email address is an important default for the
following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  An email address is, by definition, unique to the user who owns it.
\item
  People can generally remember their email addresses. If you have users
  who haven't logged into the portal for a while, it is possible they
  will forget their screen names, especially if they weren't allowed to
  use their screen names of choice (because they were already taken).
\item
  If a user changes his or her email address, it is more likely the user
  will forget to update his or her email address in his or her profile,
  if the email address is not used to authenticate. If the user's email
  address is not updated, all notifications sent by the portal will fail
  to reach the user. So it is important to keep the email address at the
  forefront of a user's mind when he or she logs in to help the user
  keep it up to date.
\end{enumerate}

Next, we'll examine how to integrate existing users from other
environments, such as LDAP servers, into Liferay.

\section{Integrating Existing Users into
Liferay}\label{integrating-existing-users-into-liferay}

Liferay provides a number of user authentication options. You can
configure Liferay to connect to LDAP or NTLM servers so users from those
environments can log in to your Liferay server. You can also configure
Liferay to allow users to log in via Facebook or OpenId accounts.
Liferay's Control Panel provides interfaces for setting up user
authentication using the following services:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  LDAP
\item
  CAS
\item
  Facebook
\item
  NTLM
\item
  OpenId
\item
  Open SSO
\item
  SiteMinder
\end{itemize}

Let's start by learning how to connect Liferay to an LDAP server.

\subsection{LDAP}\label{ldap}

You can use the LDAP tab of the Authentication page to connect Liferay
to an LDAP directory. There are two places for you to configure the LDAP
settings: here in the Control Panel or in your Liferay server's
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. You can browse an HTML version of
Liferay's \texttt{portal.properties} file online at
\url{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html}.
We recommend you use the Control Panel to configure LDAP server
connection settings since your settings will be stored in the database.
Note that if you use both, the settings in the database will be merged
with the settings in \texttt{portal-ext.properties}. If there's a
conflict or overlapping data, the LDAP server settings in the database
take precedence over the servers set in the
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. Configuring the LDAP settings from
the Control Panel is easier and does not require a restart of Liferay.
The only compelling reason to use the \texttt{portal-ext.properties}
file is if you have many Liferay nodes which need be configured to run
against the same LDAP directory. In that case, for your initial
deployment, it may be easier to copy the \texttt{portal-ext.properties}
file to all of the nodes so the first time they start up, the settings
are correct. Regardless of which method you use, the available settings
are the same.

You configure the global values from the LDAP tab of the Authentication
page.

\textbf{Enabled:} Check this box to enable LDAP Authentication.

\textbf{Required:} Check this box if LDAP authentication is required.
Liferay will then not allow a user to log in unless he or she can
successfully bind to the LDAP directory first. Uncheck this box if you
want to allow users with Liferay accounts but no LDAP accounts to log in
to the portal.

\textbf{LDAP Servers:} Liferay supports connections to multiple LDAP
servers. You can you the Add button beneath this heading to add LDAP
servers. We explain how to configure new LDAP servers below.

\textbf{Import/Export:} You can import and export user data from LDAP
directories using the following options:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Import Enabled:} Check this box to cause Liferay to do a mass
  import from your LDAP directories. If you want Liferay to only
  synchronize users when they log in, leave this box unchecked.
  Definitely leave this unchecked if you are working in a clustered
  environment. Otherwise, all of your nodes would try to do a mass
  import when each of them starts up.
\item
  \emph{Import on Startup Enabled:} Check this box to have Liferay run
  the import when it starts up. Note: This box only appears if you check
  the \emph{Import Enabled} box above.
\item
  \emph{Export Enabled:} Check this box to enable Liferay to export user
  accounts from the database to LDAP. Liferay uses a listener to track
  any changes made to the \texttt{User} object and will push these
  changes out to the LDAP server whenever the \texttt{User} object is
  updated. Note that by default on every login, fields such as
  \texttt{LastLoginDate} are updated. When export is enabled, this has
  the effect of causing a user export every time the user logs in. You
  can disable this by setting the following property in your
  \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
users.update.last.login=false
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Use LDAP Password Policy:} Liferay uses its own password policy
by default. This can be configured on the Password Policies page of the
Control Panel. Check the \emph{Use LDAP Password Policy} box if you want
to use the password policies defined by your LDAP directory. Once this
is enabled, the Password Policies tab will display a message stating you
are not using a local password policy. You will now have to use your
LDAP directory's mechanism for setting password policies. Liferay does
this by parsing the messages in the LDAP controls returned by your LDAP
server. By default, the messages in the LDAP controls that Liferay is
looking for are the messages returned by the Fedora Directory Server. If
you are using a different LDAP server, you will need to customize the
messages in Liferay's \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file, as there is
not yet a GUI for setting this. See below for instructions describing
how to do this.

Once you've finished configuring LDAP, click the \emph{Save} button.
Next, let's look at how to add LDAP servers.

\subsubsection{Adding LDAP Servers}\label{adding-ldap-servers}

The Add button beneath the LDAP servers heading allows you to add LDAP
servers. If you have more than one, you can arrange the servers by order
of preference using the up/down arrows. When you add an LDAP Server, you
will need to provide several pieces of data so Liferay can bind to that
LDAP server and search it for user records. Regardless of how many LDAP
servers you add, each server has the same configuration options.

\textbf{Server Name:} Enter a name for your LDAP server.

\textbf{Default Values:} Several leading directory servers are listed
here. If you are using one of these, select it and click the \emph{Reset
Values} button. The rest of the form will be populated with the proper
default values for that directory.

\textbf{Connection:} These settings cover the basic connection to LDAP.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Base Provider URL:} This tells the portal where the LDAP server
  is located. Make sure the machine on which Liferay is installed can
  communicate with the LDAP server. If there is a firewall between the
  two systems, check to make sure the appropriate ports are opened.
\item
  \emph{Base DN:} This is the Base Distinguished Name for your LDAP
  directory. It is usually modeled after your organization. For a
  commercial organization, it may look similar to this:
  \texttt{dc=companynamehere,dc=com}.
\item
  \emph{Principal:} By default, the administrator ID is populated here.
  If you have removed the default LDAP administrator, you will need to
  use the fully qualified name of the administrative credential you use
  instead. You need an administrative credential because Liferay will be
  using this ID to synchronize user accounts to and from LDAP .
\item
  \emph{Credentials:} This is the password for the administrative user.
\end{itemize}

This is all you need to make a regular connection to an LDAP directory.
The rest of the configuration is optional. Generally, the default
attribute mappings provide enough data to synchronize back to the
Liferay database when a user attempts to log in. To test the connection
to your LDAP server, click the \emph{Test LDAP Connection} button.

If you are running your LDAP directory in SSL mode to prevent credential
information from passing through the network unencrypted, you will have
to perform extra steps to share the encryption key and certificate
between the two systems.

For example, assuming your LDAP directory happens to be Microsoft Active
Directory on Windows Server 2003, you would take the following steps to
share the certificate:

Click \emph{Start} $\rightarrow$\emph{Administrative Tools} $\rightarrow$\emph{Certificate
Authority}. Highlight the machine that is the certificate authority,
right-click on it, and click \emph{Properties}. From the General menu,
click \emph{View Certificate}. Select the Details view, and click
\emph{Copy To File}. Use the resulting wizard to save the certificate as
a file. As with the CAS install (see the below section entitled
\emph{Single Sign-On}), you will need to import the certificate into the
\emph{cacerts keystore}. The import is handled by a command like the
following:

\begin{verbatim}
keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore [path-to-jdk]/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass \ 
changeit -noprompt -alias MyRootCA -file /some/path/MyRootCA.cer
\end{verbatim}

The \emph{keytool} utility ships as part of the Java SDK.

Once this is done, go back to the LDAP page in the Control Panel. Modify
the LDAP URL in the Base DN field to the secure version by changing the
protocol to \texttt{https} and the port to \texttt{636} like the
following:

\begin{verbatim}
ldaps://myLdapServerHostname:636
\end{verbatim}

Save the changes. Your Liferay Portal will now use LDAP in secure mode
for authentication.

\textbf{Users:} This section contains settings for finding users in your
LDAP directory.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Authentication Search Filter:} The search filter box can be used
  to determine the search criteria for user logins. By default, Liferay
  uses users' email addresses for their login names. If you have changed
  this setting, you will need to modify the search filter here, which
  has been configured to use the email address attribute from LDAP as a
  search criterion. For example, if you changed Liferay's authentication
  method to use screen names instead of the email addresses, you would
  modify the search filter so it can match the entered log in name:

\begin{verbatim}
(cn=@screen_name@)
\end{verbatim}
\item
  \emph{Import Search Filter:} Depending on the LDAP server,
  there are different ways to identify the user. The default setting is
  usually fine:

\begin{verbatim}
(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)
\end{verbatim}

  If you want to search for only a subset of users or users that have
  different LDAP object classes, you can change this.
\item
  \emph{User Mapping:} The next series of fields allows you to define
  mappings from LDAP attributes to Liferay fields. Though your LDAP user
  attributes may be different from LDAP server to LDAP server, there are
  five fields Liferay requires to be mapped for the user to be
  recognized. You must define a mapping to the corresponding attributes
  in LDAP for the following Liferay fields:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{Screen Name} (e.g., \emph{uid})
  \item
    \emph{Password} (e.g., \emph{userPassword})
  \item
    \emph{Email Address} (e.g., \emph{mail} or \emph{email})
  \item
    \emph{First Name} (e.g., \emph{name} or \emph{givenName})
  \item
    \emph{Last Name} (e.g., \emph{sn})
  \end{itemize}

  If you'd like to import LDAP groups as Liferay user groups, make sure
  to define a mapping for the Liferay group field so that membership
  information is preserved:

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    \emph{Group} (e.g., \emph{member})
  \end{itemize}

  The other LDAP user mapping fields are optional.
\end{itemize}

The Control Panel provides default mappings for commonly used LDAP
attributes. You can also add your own mappings if you wish.

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{Test LDAP Users:} Once you have your attribute mappings set up
  (see above), click the \emph{Test LDAP Users} button and Liferay will
  attempt to pull LDAP users and match them with their mappings as a
  preview.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/server-configuration-testing-ldap-users.jpg}
\caption{\\Figure 17.2: Testing LDAP Users}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Groups:} This section contains settings for mapping LDAP groups
to Liferay user groups.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Import Search Filter:} This is the filter for finding the LDAP
  groups that you want to map to Liferay user groups. E.g.,

\begin{verbatim}
(objectClass=groupOfNames)
\end{verbatim}

  Enter the LDAP group attributes you want retrieved for this mapping.
  The following attributes can be mapped. The \emph{Group Name} and
  \emph{User} fields are required, the \emph{Description} is optional.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{Group Name} (e.g., \emph{cn} or \emph{o})
  \item
    \emph{Description} (e.g., \emph{description})
  \item
    \emph{User} (e.g., \emph{member})
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Test LDAP Groups:} Click the \emph{Test LDAP Groups} button to
  display a list of the groups returned by your search filter.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Export:} This section contains settings for exporting user data
from LDAP.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Users DN:} Enter the location in your LDAP tree where the users
  will be stored. When Liferay does an export, it will export the users
  to this location.
\item
  \emph{User Default Object Classes:} When a user is exported, the user
  is created with the listed default object classes. To find out what
  your default object classes are, use an LDAP browser tool such as
  JXplorer to locate a user and view the Object Class attributes stored
  in LDAP for that user.
\item
  \emph{Groups DN:} Enter the location in your LDAP tree where the
  groups will be stored. When Liferay does an export, it will export the
  groups to this location.
\item
  \emph{Group Default Object Classes:} When a group is exported, the
  group is created with the listed default object classes. To find out
  what your default object classes are, use an LDAP browser tool such as
  \emph{Jxplorer} to locate a group and view the Object Class attributes
  stored in LDAP for that group.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/server-configuration-mapping-ldap-groups.jpg}
\caption{\\Figure 17.3: Mapping LDAP Groups}
\end{figure}

Once you've set all your options and tested your connection, click
\emph{Save}. From here, you can add another LDAP server or set just a
few more options that apply to all of your LDAP server connections.

\subsubsection{LDAP Options Not Available in the
GUI}\label{ldap-options-not-available-in-the-gui}

Although most of the LDAP configuration can be done from the Control
Panel, there are several configuration parameters that are only
available by adding to your Liferay server's
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. These options may be available in
the GUI in future versions of Liferay Portal but for now they can only
be configured by editing the properties file.

If you need to change any of these options, copy the LDAP section from
Liferay's \texttt{por\-tal.pro\-per\-ties} file into your
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. Note that since you have already
configured LDAP from the GUI, any settings from the properties file that
match settings already configured in the GUI will be ignored. The GUI,
which stores the settings in the database, always takes precedence over
the properties file.

\begin{verbatim}
ldap.auth.method=bind
#ldap.auth.method=password-compare
\end{verbatim}

Set either bind or password-compare for the LDAP authentication method.
Bind is preferred by most vendors so you don't have to worry about
encryption strategies. Password compare does exactly what it sounds
like: it reads the user's password out of LDAP, decrypts it and compares
it with the user's password in Liferay, syncing the two.

\begin{verbatim}
ldap.auth.password.encryption.algorithm=
ldap.auth.password.encryption.algorithm.types=MD5,SHA
\end{verbatim}

Set the password encryption to used to compare passwords if the property
\texttt{ldap\-.auth\-.me\-thod} is set to \texttt{password-compare}.

\begin{verbatim}
ldap.import.method=[user,group]
\end{verbatim}

If you set this to \texttt{user}, Liferay will import all users from the
specified portion of the LDAP tree. If you set this to \texttt{group},
Liferay will search all the groups and import the users in each group.
If you have users who do not belong to any groups, they will not be
imported.

\begin{verbatim}
ldap.error.password.age=age
ldap.error.password.expired=expired
ldap.error.password.history=history
ldap.error.password.not.changeable=not allowed to change
ldap.error.password.syntax=syntax
ldap.error.password.trivial=trivial
ldap.error.user.lockout=retry limit
\end{verbatim}

These properties are a list of phrases from error messages which can
possibly be returned by the LDAP server. When a user binds to LDAP, the
server can return \emph{controls} with its response of success or
failure. These controls contain a message describing the error or the
information that is coming back with the response. Though the controls
are the same across LDAP servers, the messages can be different. The
properties described here contain snippets of words from those messages
and will work with Red Hat's Fedora Directory Server. If you are not
using that server, the word snippets may not work with your LDAP server.
If they don't, you can replace the values of these properties with
phrases from your server's error messages. This will enable Liferay to
recognize them. Next, let's look at the Single Sign-On solutions Liferay
supports.

\subsection{SSO}\label{sso}

Single Sign-On solutions allow you to provide a single login credential
for multiple systems. This allows you to have people authenticate to the
Single Sign-On product and they will be automatically logged in to
Liferay and to other products as well.

Liferay supports several single sign-on solutions. Of course, if your
product is not yet supported, you may choose to implement support for it
yourself by use of the extension environment. Alternatively, your
organization can choose to sponsor support for it. Please contact
\texttt{sales@liferay.com} for more information about this.

\subsection{Authentication: Central Authentication Service
(CAS)}\label{authentication-central-authentication-service-cas}

CAS is an authentication system originally created at Yale University.
It is a widely-used open source single sign-on solution and was the
first SSO product to be supported by Liferay.

Please follow the documentation for CAS to install it on your
application server of choice.

Your first step will be to copy the CAS client .jar file to Liferay's
library folder. On Tomcat, this is in
\texttt{{[}Tomcat Home{]}/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib}. Once you've done
this, the CAS client will be available to Liferay the next time you
start it.

The CAS Server application requires a properly configured Secure Socket
Layer certificate on your server to work. If you wish to generate one
yourself, you will need to use the \texttt{keytool} utility that comes
with the JDK. Your first step is to generate the key. Next, you export
the key into a file. Finally, you import the key into your local Java
key store. For public, Internet-based production environments, you will
need to either purchase a signed key from a recognized certificate
authority (such as Thawte or Verisign) or have your key signed by a
recognized certificate authority. For Intranets, you should have your IT
department pre-configure users' browsers to accept the certificate so
they don't get warning messages about the certificate.

To generate a key, use the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keypass changeit -keyalg RSA
\end{verbatim}

Instead of the password in the example (\texttt{changeit}), use a
password you will remember. If you are not using Tomcat, you may want to
use a different alias as well. For First and Last names, enter
\texttt{localhost} or the host name of your server. It cannot be an IP
address.

To export the key to a file, use the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
keytool -export -alias tomcat -keypass changeit -file server.cert
\end{verbatim}

Finally, to import the key into your Java key store, use the following
command:

\begin{verbatim}
keytool -import -alias tomcat -file %FILE_NAME% -keypass changeit 
-keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts
\end{verbatim}

If you are on a Windows system, replace \texttt{\$JAVA\_HOME} above with
\texttt{\%JAVA\_HOME\%}. Of course, all of this needs to be done on the
system on which CAS will be running.

Once your CAS server is up and running, you can configure Liferay to use
it. This is a simple matter of navigating to the \emph{Settings →
Authentication $\rightarrow$CAS} tab in the Control Panel. Enable CAS
authentication and then modify the URL properties to point to your CAS
server.

\textbf{Enabled:} Check this box to enable CAS single sign-on.

\textbf{Import from LDAP:} A user may be authenticated from CAS and not
yet exist in the portal. Select this to automatically import users from
LDAP if they do not exist in the portal.

The rest of the settings are various URLs, with defaults included.
Change \emph{localhost} in the default values to point to your CAS
server. When you are finished, click \emph{Save}. After this, when users
click the \emph{Sign In} link, they will be directed to the CAS server
to sign in to Liferay.

\subsection{Authentication: Facebook}\label{authentication-facebook}

Liferay Portal also enables users to log in using their Facebook
accounts. To enable this feature, you simply need to select the
\emph{Enable} box and enter the Application ID and Application Secret
which should have been provided to you by Facebook. Facebook SSO works
by taking the primary Facebook email address and searching for the same
email address in Liferay's \texttt{User\_} table. If a match is found,
the user is automatically signed on (provided the user clicked
\emph{allow} from the Facebook dialog). If there isn't a match, the user
is prompted in Liferay to add a user from Facebook. Once selected, a new
user is created by retrieving four fields from Facebook (first name,
last name, email address and gender).

\subsection{Authentication: NTLM}\label{authentication-ntlm}

NTLM is a Microsoft protocol that can be used for authentication through
Microsoft Internet Explorer. Though Microsoft has adopted Kerberos in
modern versions of Windows server, NTLM is still used when
authenticating to a workgroup. Liferay Portal now supports NTLM v2
authentication. NTLM v2 is more secure and has a stronger authentication
process than NTLMv1.

\textbf{Enabled:} Check this box to enable NTLM authentication.

\textbf{Domain Controller:} Enter the IP address of your domain
controller. This is the server that contains the user accounts you want
to use with Liferay.

\textbf{Domain:} Enter the domain / workgroup name.

\textbf{Service Account:} You need to create a service account for NTLM.
This account will be a computer account, not a user account.

\textbf{Service Password:} Enter the password for the service account.

\subsection{Authentication: OpenID}\label{authentication-openid}

OpenID is a new single sign-on standard which is implemented by multiple
vendors. The idea is multiple vendors can implement the standard and
then users can register for an ID with the vendor they trust. The
credential issued by that vendor can be used by all the web sites that
support OpenID. Some high profile OpenID vendors are AOL, LiveDoor, and
LiveJournal. 

Please see the OpenID site
\footnote{\href{http://www.openid.net/}{http://www.openid.net}} for a more complete
list.

A main benefit of OpenID for the user is he or she no longer has to
register for a new account on every site in which he or she wants to
participate. Users can register on \emph{one} site (the OpenID
provider's site) and then use those credentials to authenticate to many
web sites which support OpenID. Many web site owners often struggle to
build communities because end users are reluctant to register for so
many different accounts. Supporting OpenID makes it easier for site
owners to build their communities because the barriers to participating
(i.e., the effort it takes to register for and keep track of many
accounts) are removed. All of the account information is kept with the
OpenID provider, making it much easier to manage this information and
keep it up to date.

Liferay Portal can act as an OpenID consumer, allowing users to
automatically register and sign in with their OpenID accounts.
Internally, the product uses OpenID4Java
\url{http://code.google.com/p/openid4java/} to implement the feature.

OpenID is enabled by default in Liferay but can be disabled here.

\subsection{Atlassian Crowd}\label{atlassian-crowd}

Atlassian Crowd is a web-based Single Sign-On product similar to CAS.
Crowd can be used to manage authentication to many different web
applications and directory servers.

Because Atlassian Crowd implements an OpenID producer, Liferay works and
has been tested with it. Simply use the OpenID authentication feature in
Liferay to log in using Crowd.

\subsection{Authentication: OpenSSO}\label{authentication-opensso}

OpenSSO is an open source single sign-on solution that comes from the
code base of Sun's System Access Manager product. Liferay integrates
with OpenSSO, allowing you to use OpenSSO to integrate Liferay into an
infrastructure that contains a multitude of different authentication
schemes against different repositories of identities.

You can set up OpenSSO on the same server as Liferay or a different box.
Follow the instructions at the OpenSSO site
\href{http://opensso.dev.java.net/}{http://opensso.dev.java.net} to
install OpenSSO. Once you have it installed, create the Liferay
administrative user in it. Users are mapped back and forth by screen
names. By default, the Liferay administrative user has a screen name of
\emph{test}, so in OpenSSO, you would register the user with the ID of
\emph{test} and an email address of \emph{test@liferay.com}. Once you
have the user set up, log in to Open SSO using this user.

In the same browser window, go to the URL for your server running
Liferay and log in as the same user, using the email address
\emph{test@liferay.com}. Go to the Control Panel and click
\emph{Settings $\rightarrow$Authentication $\rightarrow$OpenSSO}. Modify the three URL fields
(Login URL, Logout URL and Service URL) so they point to your OpenSSO
server (i.e., only modify the host name portion of the URLs), click the
\emph{Enabled} check box and then click \emph{Save}. Liferay will then
redirect users to OpenSSO when they click the \emph{Sign In} link.

\subsection{Authentication: SiteMinder}\label{authentication-siteminder}

SiteMinder is a single sign-on implementation from Computer Associates.
Liferay 5.2 introduced built-in integration with SiteMinder. SiteMinder
uses a custom HTTP header to implement its single sign-on solution.

To enable SiteMinder authentication in Liferay, check the \emph{Enabled}
box on the \emph{SiteMinder} tab. If you are also using LDAP with
Liferay, you can check the \emph{Import from LDAP} box. If this box is
checked, users authenticated from SiteMinder who do not exist in the
portal will be imported from LDAP.

The last field defines the header SiteMinder is using to keep track of
the user. The default value is already populated. If you have customized
the field for your installation, enter the custom value here.

When you are finished, click \emph{Save}. Now that we've looked at
various options for integrating existing users into Liferay, let's look
at other Liferay portal settings.

\subsection{Shibboleth}\label{shibboleth}

Shibboleth is a federated single sign-on and attribute exchange
framework that implements SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language). The
Shibboleth plugin available from Liferay Marketplace allows Liferay to
integrate with Shibboleth to provide SSO support. The Liferay Shibboleth
plugin contains an autologin hook that automatically logs users into
Liferay when they are authenticated to a Shibboleth identity provider
and the HTTP request has a specific header attribute. All of the
Shibboleth service provider and identity provider configuration is done
outside of Liferay. All that the Liferay Shibboleth plugin needs to do
is accept the header attribute from Shibboleth and log the user in.

The Shibboleth plugin adds a Shibboleth tab to the Authentication page
of the Portal Settings section of the Control Panel.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/shibboleth.png}
\caption{\\Figure 17.4: You can enable/disable Shibboleth authentication
for Liferay by navigating to the \emph{Control Panel} $\rightarrow$\emph{Portal
Settings} \&rrar; \emph{Authentication} $\rightarrow$\emph{Shibboleth}.}
\end{figure}

There are four configuration options:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{Enabled}
\item
  \emph{Import from LDAP}
\item
  \emph{Logout URL}
\item
  \emph{User Header}
\end{itemize}

Check or uncheck the \emph{Enabled} box to enable or disable Shibboleth
authentication for Liferay. If the \emph{Enabled} box is not checked,
the Shibboleth auto login hook is disabled and the automated login
process will not work even if the user header is in the HTTP request. If
you check the \emph{Import from LDAP} box, then any users authenticated
from Shibboleth that do not exist in Liferay will be imported into
Liferay from LDAP. LDAP must already be enabled for this to work. The
path you enter into the \emph{Logout URL} field sets the logout URL for
Shibboleth. The link is triggered when the user logs out of the portal.
If the logout URL is incorrect or is not set, the user will not be
logged out of Shibboleth. The \emph{User Header} is the attribute name
of the user header that is passed in from the Shibboleth service
provider. It should contain either the screen name or the email address
of the user, which will be used to authenticate the user into the
portal.

It's possible to configure the above four Shibboleth options via portal
properties instead of via the Control Panel. To configure the Shibboleth
plugin this way, add the following properties to your Liferay server's
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file and restart Liferay.

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \texttt{shibboleth.auth.enabled=true}: corresponds to the
  \emph{Enable} box above
\item
  \texttt{shibboleth.import.from.ldap=false}: corresponds to the
  \emph{Import from LDAP} box above
\item
  \texttt{shibboleth.logout.url=/Shibboleth.soo/Logout}: corresponds to
  the \emph{Logout URL} box above
\item
  \texttt{shibboleth.auth.enabled=true}: corresponds the \emph{User
  Header} box above
\end{itemize}

Note that options selected via the Control Panel are saved to Liferay's
database and take precedence over any options configured via portal
properties.

\subsection{SAML}\label{saml}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.25\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/ee-feature-web.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

SAML is an XML-based open standard data format for exchanging
authentication and authorization data between parties known as an
identity provider and a service provider. An identity provider is a
trusted provider that enables users to use single sign-on to access
other websites. A service provider is a website that hosts applications
and grants access only to identified users with proper credentials. SAML
is maintained by the OASIS Security Services Technical Committee. See
\url{https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/security/} for more
information. Liferay 6.1 EE and later versions support SAML 2.0
integration via the SAML 2.0 Provider EE plugin. This plugin is provided
as an app from Liferay Marketplace that allows Liferay to act as a SAML
2.0 identity provider or as a service provider. First, we'll look at how
to set Liferay up as an Identity Provider and then we'll look at how to
set it up as a Service Provider.

\subsubsection{Setting up Liferay as a SAML Identity
Provider}\label{setting-up-liferay-as-a-saml-identity-provider}

In order to set Liferay up to act as a SAML Identity Provider, use the
following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Install the SAML 2.0 Provider EE app, either via the Control Panel's
  Marketplace interface or manually. To confirm that the plugin was
  successfully deployed, look for the \emph{SAML Admin} entry in the
  Portal section of the Control Panel.
\item
  Next, you need to generate a keystore to use with SAML. You can
  generate a keystore using the Java keytool utility. Navigate to your
  \texttt{{[}Liferay    Home{]}/data} directory in a command prompt or
  terminal and run the following command to generate a keystore there:

\begin{verbatim}
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias liferaysamlidp -keystore keystore.jks  \ 
-storepass liferay -validity 360 -keysize 2048
\end{verbatim}

  Upon running this command, you'll be prompted to enter the following
  information:

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    First and last name
  \item
    Name of your organizational unit
  \item
    Name of your organization
  \item
    Name of your city or locality
  \item
    Name of your state or province
  \item
    Your country's two-letter country code
  \end{itemize}

  This information will be included in the keystore. After you answer
  the questions, a keystore named \texttt{keystore.jks} is created with
  the alias (entity ID) \texttt{liferaysamlidp} and the password
  \texttt{liferay}. To keep this example simple, use the same password
  for \texttt{liferaysamlidp} as for the keystore itself:
  \texttt{liferay}.
\item
  Log in to your portal as an administrator and click on the \emph{SAML
  Admin} entry in the Control Panel. For the SAML role, select
  \emph{Identity Provider}, and for the Entity ID, enter the alias of
  the keystore you generated in your Liferay instance's data folder:
  \texttt{liferaysamlidp}. Then click \emph{Save}.
\item
  After clicking \emph{Save}, additional options appear in the SAML
  Admin Control Panel portlet. There are three tabs:

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    General
  \item
    Identity Provider
  \item
    Service Provider Connections
  \end{itemize}

  Leave the SAML role and Entity role as you configured them in step 3.
  In the Certificate and Private Key section, enter the same information
  that you entered when you generated your keystore, then click
  \emph{Save}. After saving your certificate and private key
  information, you can view information about your certificate or
  download your certificate.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Finally, after you've saved your certificate and private key
  information, check the \emph{Enabled} box at the top of the General
  tab and click \emph{Save}. Great! You've successfully set Liferay up
  as a SAML Identity Provider!
\end{enumerate}

To configure Liferay's SAML Identity Provider Settings, navigate to the
Identity Provider tab of the SAML Admin Control Panel portlet. Of
course, setting up Liferay as a SAML Identity Provider is only useful if
you can connect to one or more SAML Service Providers. Navigate to the
Service Provider Connections tab of the SAML Admin Control Panel portlet
and click on the \emph{Add Service Provider} button to add a SAML
Service Provider. Right now, we don't have one to add but next, we'll
learn how to set Liferay up as a SAML Service Provider.

After you've set up another Liferay instance as a Service Provider, you
can come back to this Liferay instance's Control Panel and add the
Service Provider: \emph{Control Panel} $\rightarrow$\emph{SAML Admin} \&rrar;
\emph{Service Provider Connections} $\rightarrow$\emph{Add Service Provider}.

\subsubsection{Setting up Liferay as a SAML Service
Provider}\label{setting-up-liferay-as-a-saml-service-provider}

In order to set Liferay up to act as a SAML Service Provider, use the
following steps. Many of the steps are similar to the ones for setting
Liferay up to act as a SAML Identity Provider. A single Liferay instance
can be configured as a SAML Identify Provider \emph{or} a SAML Service
Provider but not both! If you've already set up one Liferay instance as
a SAML Identity Provider, use a \emph{different} Liferay instance as a
SAML Service Provider

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Install the SAML 2.0 Provider EE app, either via the control panel's
  Marketplace interface or manually. To confirm that the plugin was
  successfully deployed, look for the \emph{SAML Admin} entry in the
  Portal section of the Control Panel.
\item
  Next, you need to generate a keystore to use with SAML. You can
  generate a keystore using the Java keytool utility. Navigate to your
  \texttt{{[}Liferay    Home{]}/data} directory in a command prompt or
  terminal and run the following command to generate a keystore there:

\begin{verbatim}
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias liferaysamlsp -keystore keystore.jks \
-storepass liferay -validity 360 -keysize 2048
\end{verbatim}

  Upon running this command, you'll be prompted to enter the following
  information:

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    First and last name
  \item
    Name of your organizational unit
  \item
    Name of your organization
  \item
    Name of your city or locality
  \item
    Name of your state or province
  \item
    Your country's two-letter country code
  \end{itemize}

  This information will be included in the keystore. After you answer
  the questions, a keystore named \texttt{keystore.jks} is created with
  the alias (entity ID) \texttt{liferaysamlsp} and the password
  \texttt{liferay}. To keep this example simple, use the same password
  for \texttt{liferaysamlsp} as for the keystore itself:
  \texttt{liferay}.
\item
  Log in to your portal as an administrator and click on the \emph{SAML
  Admin} entry in the Control Panel. For the SAML role, select
  \emph{Service Provider}, and for the Entity ID, enter the alias of the
  keystore you generated in your Liferay instance's data folder:
  \texttt{liferaysamlsp}. Then click \emph{Save}.
\item
  After clicking \emph{Save}, additional options appear in the SAML
  Admin Control Panel portlet. Note that these options are different
  than if you were setting up Liferay as an Identity Provider. There are
  three tabs:

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    General
  \item
    Service Provider (not Identity Provider!)
  \item
    Identity Provider Connection (not Service Provider Connections!)
  \end{itemize}

  Leave the SAML role and Entity role as you configured them in step 3.
  In the Certificate and Private Key section, enter the same information
  that you entered when you generated your keystore, then click
  \emph{Save}. After saving your certificate and private key
  information, you can view information about your certificate or
  download your certificate.
\item
  Next, you need to configure an Identity Provider connection. Click on
  the \emph{Identity Provider Connection} tab. Enter a name for the
  Identity Provider, enter its entity ID, and enter its metadata URL. If
  you already configured a separate Liferay instance as an Identify
  provider following the previous instructions, you'd enter the
  following information:

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Name: \emph{Liferay IdP}
  \item
    Entity ID: \emph{liferaysamlidp}
  \item
    Metadata URL: \emph{http://localhost:8080/c/portal/saml/metadata}
    (test this URL first)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Finally, after you've saved your certificate and private key
  information and configured an Identity Provider connection, check the
  \emph{Enabled} box at the top of the General tab and click
  \emph{Save}. Great! You've successfully set Liferay up as a SAML
  Service Provider!
\end{enumerate}

If you'd like to configure Liferay's SAML Service Provider Settings,
navigate to the Service Provider tab of the SAML Admin Control Panel
portlet.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} The previous two sections explained how to use the SAML
portlet's Control Panel interface to configure Liferay as an Identity
Provider and as a Service Provider. It's possible to configure Liferay
as an Identity Provider or as a Service Provider entirely through the
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. However, we recommend using the
Control Panel SAML interface because it specifies required fields and
validates some fields.

\end{roundedframe}
Suppose that you have two Liferay instances running on ports 8080 and
9080 of your host. Suppose further that you've configured the Liferay
running on port 8080 as a SAML Identity Provider and the Liferay running
on port 9080 as a SAML Service Provider, following the instructions
above. If your Identity Provider and Service Provider have been
correctly configured, navigating to
\texttt{http://lo\-cal\-host:8080\-/c\-/por\-tal\-/sa\-ml\-/sso\-?en\-ti\-ty\-Id=\-life\-ray\-sa\-ml\-sp}
initiates the SAML Identity Provider based login process. To initiate
the SAML Service Provider based login process, just navigate to the
Liferay running on port 9080 and click \emph{Sign In}, navigate to
\url{http://localhost:9080/c/portal/login}, or try to access a protected
resource URL such as a Control Panel URL.

\section{Configuring Additional Portal
Settings}\label{configuring-additional-portal-settings}

Go back to the Control Panel, and click on \emph{Portal Settings} under
the \emph{Configuration} heading. We've already looked at the options
available from the \emph{General} and \emph{Authentication} links. Now
let's examine the other portal settings options.

\subsection{Users}\label{users}

If you click on \emph{Users} from the Portal Settings screen, you'll
find three tabs: Fields, Reserved Credentials and Default User
Associations.

The Fields tab allows you to enable/disable the following fields:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Enable/disable requiring the Terms of Use
\item
  Enable/disable user screen names autogeneration
\item
  Enable/disable requiring the last names
\item
  Enable/disable the birthday field
\item
  Enable/disable the gender field
\end{itemize}

The next tab is Reserved Credentials. You can enter screen names and
email addresses here that you don't want others to use. Liferay will
then prevent users from registering with these screen names and email
addresses. You might use this feature to prevent users from creating IDs
that look like administrative IDs or that have reserved words in their
names.

The Default User Associations tab has three fields allowing you to list
(one per line) sites, roles, and user groups you want new users to
become members of automatically. By default, Liferay assigns new users
to both the Users role and the Power Users role.

If you have defined other user groups, sites or roles you want newly
created users to be members of by default, enter them here. For example,
you may have defined site templates in certain user groups to
pre-populate end users' private pages. If there is a particular
configuration you want everyone to have, you may want to enter those
user groups here.

\subsection{Mail Host Names}\label{mail-host-names}

Mail Host Names appears after Authentication and Users on the Portal
Settings screen of the Control Panel. You can enter other mail host
names (one per line) besides the one you configured on the General tab.
This lets the portal know which mail host names are owned by your
organization.

\subsection{Email Notifications}\label{email-notifications}

There are five tabs under the Email Notifications page of Portal
Settings. The Sender tab allows you to set the portal's administrative
name and email address. By default, these are \texttt{Joe Bloggs} and
\texttt{test@liferay.com}. You can change them to whatever you want.
This name and email address will appear in the From field in all email
messages sent by the portal.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/server-configuration-account-created-notification.png}
\caption{\\Figure 17.5: You can customize the email template for the email
messages sent to users who have just created their accounts.}
\end{figure}

The other four tabs are Account Created Notification, Email Verification
Notification, Password Changed Notification and Password Reset
Notification. These tabs allow you to customize the email messages that
are sent to users each time any of those four events occur.

A list of tokens, entitled ``Definition of Terms,'' is provided so you
can insert certain values (such as the portal URL or the user ID) when
you are setting up the custom email messages.

\subsection{Content Sharing}\label{content-sharing}

The Content Sharing section of the Portal Settings area of the Control
Panel allows you to choose whether or or not site administrators can
display content in sites from other sites they administer. For example,
suppose that a certain user is a site administrator of two sites:
\emph{Engineering} and \emph{Marketing}. The checkbox in the Content
Sharing section of Portal Settings determines whether or not the site
administrator can display content from the Marketing site in the
Engineering site and vice versa.

The Content Sharing section of Portal Settings also allows you to choose
a behavior for whether or not subsites can display content from parent
sites and for configuring the defaults. There are three options:

\textbf{Enabled by Default}: This means that subsites can display
content from parent sites by default but this can be disabled by a site
administrator.

\textbf{Disabled by Default}: This means that subsites cannot display
content from parent sites by default but this can be enabled by a site
administrator.

\textbf{Disabled}: This means that subsites cannot display content from
parent sites and this behavior cannot be changed by a site
administrator.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{../../images/server-configuration-definition-of-terms.png}
\caption{\\Figure 17.6: You can refer to this list of variables that's
available for use in email templates.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Identification}\label{identification}

The identification section has several links for addresses, phone
numbers and other information you can configure in your portal. This
allows you to set up contact information for the organization that owns
the portal. Developers can query for this information in their
applications.

\subsection{Miscellaneous: Display
Settings}\label{miscellaneous-display-settings}

This section allows you to set the default portal language and the time
zone. You can also set up a portal-wide logo which appears in the top
left corners of portal pages.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/server-configuration-miscellaneous-display-settings.png}
\caption{\\Figure 17.7: You can specify various display settings for your
portal including options for the default language, other available
language, time zone, portal logo, and default themes for the portal and
Control Panel.}
\end{figure}

Liferay's default theme is configured to display the portal logo. For
custom themes, you can choose whether or not to display the logo. Be
careful to choose an image file that fits the space. If you pick
something too big, it might overlap with the navigation. Next, let's
look at how to customize different types of portal assets using custom
fields.

\section{Custom Fields}\label{custom-fields}

Custom fields appear beneath Portal Settings under the Configuration
heading of the Control Panel. Custom fields are a way to add attributes
to many types of assets and resources in the portal. For example, if
you're using Liferay Portal to create a site for rating books, you might
create a custom field called \emph{Favorite Books} for User resource. If
you're using the Wiki for book reviews, you might add fields called
\emph{Book Title} and \emph{Book Author}.

It's possible to add custom fields to following kinds of portal
resources:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Blogs Entry
\item
  Bookmarks Entry
\item
  Bookmarks Folder
\item
  Calendar Booking
\item
  Document
\item
  Documents Folder
\item
  Message Boards Category
\item
  Message Boards Message
\item
  Organization
\item
  Page
\item
  Role
\item
  Site
\item
  User
\item
  User Group
\item
  Web Content Article
\item
  Wiki Page
\end{itemize}

The ability to add custom fields to any of these resources affords
flexibility to portal developers. For example, suppose you'd like to
define a limitation on the number of users that can be assigned to
certain roles. A portal administrator can create a custom field called
\emph{max-users} for the Role resource. Then a portal developer can
create a hook plugin that checks this field upon user assignment to
roles to make sure that there aren't too many users assigned to the
role.

To add a custom field, click on the \emph{Custom Fields} link in the
Control Panel. Then choose a resource, click on the \emph{Edit} link
next to it and select \emph{Add Custom Field}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/server-configuration-custom-fields-resource-list.png}
\caption{\\Figure 17.8: You can add custom fields to these portal
resources.}
\end{figure}

From here you need to add the custom field key. The key appears as the
label for the field on the form. For some portal resources (like the
User), custom fields are a separate section of the form. For others, as
can be seen above, custom fields are integrated with the default fields
on the form. Additionally, developers can access custom fields
programatically through the
\texttt{\textless{}liferay-ui:custom-attribute /\textgreater{}} tag.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/server-configuration-custom-fields-integrated.png}
\caption{\\Figure 17.9: The \texttt{book-author} and \texttt{book-title}
custom fields are integrated with the rest of the form for editing a
Wiki page.}
\end{figure}

You can create fields of many different types: text fields (indexed or
secret), integers, selection of multiple values and more. Once you've
created a field, you cannot change its type. However, you can delete
custom fields and create new ones. Next, let's look at how to apply
server configurations.

\section{Server Administration}\label{server-administration}

The Server Administration page of the Control Panel lets you perform
various tasks related to the portal server itself that aren't directly
related to the resources in the portal. Clicking the link makes this
clear: you're immediately presented with a graph showing the resources
available in the JVM.

\subsection{Resources}\label{resources}

The first tab is called \emph{Resources}. This tab contains the
aforementioned graph plus several server wide actions that an
administrator can execute. These include the following:

\textbf{Run the garbage collector:} You can send in a request to the JVM
to begin the garbage collection task.

\textbf{Clear content cached by this VM:} You can send in a request to
the JVM to clear content stored in the local cache. Ehcache usage is
split into two groups: local JVM scope and cluster scope. This action
only clears the content of the local Ehcache.

\textbf{Clear content cached across the cluster:} You can send in a
request to the JVM to clear content cached across the entire cluster.
This action clears the content of the clustered Ehcache.

\textbf{Clear the database cache:} You can send in a request to the JVM
to clear the database cache. Liferay uses Ehcache mainly, but not only,
at the persistence layer for caching objects obtained from the database.
This action only clears the database result cache.

\textbf{Clear the direct servlet cache:} You can send in a request to
the JVM to clear the direct servlet cache. The direct servlet context is
a feature that optimizes JSP serving performance by caching and
accessing the generated servlets directly instead of accessing them over
the application server's dispatcher chain. This is only suitable for
cases where no filter is required for the JSPs. For production mode,
this cache should be enabled to improve performance. In case emergency
fixes need to be applied, this action allows an administrator to
manually clear out the cache to force JSPs to reload. For development
mode, the direct servlet context should be disabled to allow JSP
servlets to be reloaded on the fly. See the Direct Servlet Context
section of the \texttt{portal.properties} file for details.

\textbf{Reindex all search indexes:} You can send in a request to
regenerate all search indexes. If you are not using a Solr search server
this will impact portal performance so try to do this at non-peak times.

\textbf{Reindex all spell check indexes:} You can send in a request to
regenerate all spell check indexes.

\textbf{Reset preview and thumbnail files for the Documents and Media
portlet:} You can send in a request to reset the preview and thumbnail
files for each item in your portal's Documents and Media libraries.

\textbf{Generate Thread Dump:} If you are performance testing, you can
generate a thread dump which can be examined later to determine if there
are any deadlocks and where they might be.

\textbf{Verify database tables of all plugins:} You can check all tables
against their indexes for accuracy of data retrieval.

\textbf{Verify Membership Policies}: You can check that existing site
membership policies have been correctly applied and automatically make
updates if necessary. For example, suppose that someone manually changed
the Liferay database or that the Liferay database was hacked, resulting
in a user being assigned to a site in violation of a site membership
policy. When the \emph{Verify Membership Policies} button is clicked,
the verify methods of all the site membership policies that have been
implemented are triggered. These methods check that all site memberships
are in accord with the site membership policies; if they are not, the
necessary changes (such as removing users from forbidden sites) are
made.

\textbf{Clean up Permissions:} This process removes the assignment of
some permissions on the Guest, User, and Power User roles to simplify
the management of ``User Customizable Pages''. Notably, the ``Add To
Page'' permissions is removed from the Guest and User roles for all
portlets. Likewise, the same permission is reduced in scope for Power
Users from portal wide to scoped to ``User Personal Site.''

\subsection{Log Levels}\label{log-levels}

The Log Levels tab of the Server Administration page allows you to
dynamically modify the log levels for any class hierarchy in the portal.
If you have custom code you have deployed which isn't in the list, you
can use the \emph{Add Category} tab to add it. If you change the log
level near the top of the class hierarchy (such as at
\texttt{com.liferay}), all the classes under that hierarchy will have
their log levels changed. If you are testing something specific, it is
much better to be as specific as you can when you change log levels.
Modifying them too high in the hierarchy generates a lot more log
messages than you need.

\subsection{Properties}\label{properties}

Liferay and the JVM contain many settings which are defined as
properties. There are two subtabs of the properties tab of the Server
Administration page: one showing system properties and one showing
portal properties.

The system properties tab shows an exhaustive list of system properties
for the JVM, as well as many Liferay system properties. This information
can be used for debugging purposes or to check the configuration of the
currently running portal.

The portal properties tab shows an exhaustive list of the portal
properties. These properties can be customized; you can peruse the full
list of customizable properties online.\footnote{\url{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html}}
If you need to check the current value of a particular property, it can
be viewed from this screen without having to shut down the portal or
open any properties files.

\subsection{CAPTCHA}\label{captcha}

By default, Liferay ships with its own simple CAPTCHA service which is
designed to thwart bots from registering for accounts on sites powered
by Liferay. If you want to instead use Google's reCAPTCHA service, you
can enable this setting from the CAPTCHA tab of the Server
Administration page.

Simply check the \emph{Enable ReCAPTCHA} box and enter your public and
private keys into the provided fields, then click \emph{Save}. Liferay
Portal will then use reCAPTCHA instead of simple CAPTCHA.

\subsection{Data Migration}\label{data-migration}

If you are upgrading from a previous release of Liferay Portal or if you
need to migrate your data from one system to another, the Data Migration
tab helps you to do that without your developers having to write custom
scripts.

The first section lets you copy your entire Liferay database from the
current database under which it is running to the database you specify
in this set of fields. You'll need to enter the driver class name (and
the driver will need to be on Liferay's classpath), the JDBC URL of the
database to which you'll be copying your data and the credentials of a
user with access to that database. Once you have all of this information
entered, click \emph{Execute} to copy the data.

The next section helps you migrate your documents. If you want to move
off of the Jackrabbit JSR-170 repository to the file system, or to the
Jackrabbit repository from the file system, or to any of the other
repositories supported by the Documents and Media library, you can do so
very easily. Make sure you have already set up your
\texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file so the hook is properly configured
before running this migration. Select the Document Library hook that
represents the location to which you want your documents to be migrated,
then click \emph{Execute}. Your documents will be migrated to the new
repository. You can then shut down Liferay, make the new repository the
default in the \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file, and then restart.

You can migrate images from the Image Gallery in the same manner. (In
Liferay 6.0 and previous versions, the Document Library and Image
Gallery were distinct repositories. In Liferay 6.1 and later versions,
these have been combined into a single Documents and Media repository.)

\subsection{File Uploads}\label{file-uploads}

Since Liferay allows users to upload files in various places, you may
want to lock down the type of files and the size of files users are
allowed to upload. The File Uploads tab of the Server Configuration tab
lets you set the overall maximum file size and then override that size
for specific applications within Liferay. You can limit the allowed file
extensions generally or by application. You have a lot of flexibility as
to how you want files to be managed within your portal.

\subsection{Mail}\label{mail}

Instead of using your Liferay server's \texttt{portal-ext.properties}
file to configure a mail server, you can configure a mail server from
the Mail tab of the Server Configuration section of the Control Panel.
If your portal is to receive mail (see, for example, our coverage of the
Message Boards portlet in chapter 8), you can connect a POP mail server.
If your portal is to send mail, which is useful for sending
notifications to users, you can connect to an SMTP server. We highly
recommend setting up mail servers for your portal.

Note that if you configure mail server settings here in the Control
Panel, these settings will override any mail server settings in your
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file.

\subsection{External Services}\label{external-services}

Liferay Portal enables users to upload and share content via the
Documents and Media library, a customizable and permissionable online
repository. Users can upload files of any type to the Documents and
Media library. Liferay ships with PDFBox and uses it to generate
automatic previews for certain types of documents, by default. You can
also install three additional tools that offer higher quality previews
and document conversion functionality: OpenOffice or LibreOffice,
ImageMagick and Xuggler. With Liferay configured to use these tools, you
can generate automatic previews for many types of files including text
files, office suite files, PDFs, images, audio files and videos. Users
will also be able to use the conversion functionality to download
documents in a variety of formats. Please see chapter 4 on Documents and
Media for more information.

LibreOffice\footnote{\url{http://www.libreoffice.org}}, ImageMagick\footnote{\url{http://www.imagemagick.org}}, and Xuggler\footnote{\url{http://xuggle.com/xuggler/}} are 
available from their respective websites. Make sure to
choose the correct versions of these applications for your operating
system. We recommend that you install the latest stable versions.
LibreOffice 3.6, ImageMagick 6.7.7, and Xuggler 5.4 work with Liferay
6.2. You need to install LibreOffice and ImageMagick manually but you
can install Xuggler from Liferay's Server Administration Control Panel
interface.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} If you're running Liferay on a Linux server and experience
a problem enabling Xuggler, check your server's glibc version. You might
have to update glibc to version 2.6 or later in order for Xuggler to
work.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}
Once you've installed these tools, you can use the External Services tab
of the Control Panel to configure Liferay to use them.

\subsubsection{OpenOffice/LibreOffice
configuration}\label{openofficelibreoffice-configuration}

OpenOffice and LibreOffice are open source office suites which are
usually run in graphical mode to create documents but they can also be
run in ``server'' mode. When run in server mode, OpenOffice and
LibreOffice can be used to convert documents to and from all of the file
types it supports. Once configured, Liferay makes use of this feature to
automatically convert content on the fly. You can install OpenOffice or
LibreOffice on the same machine upon which Liferay is running or you can
connect to a separate host.

If you've installed OpenOffice or LibreOffice on the same machine that's
running Life\-ray, you can start it in server mode with the following
command:

\begin{verbatim}
soffice --headless --accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;"
--nofirststartwizard
\end{verbatim}

Once OpenOffice or LibreOffice has been installed and is running in
server mode, you can configure Liferay to use it either in your
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file or from the Control Panel. To enable
OpenOffice/LibreOffice in your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file, add
the following line:

\begin{verbatim}
openoffice.server.enabled=true
\end{verbatim}

If OpenOffice or LibreOffice is running on another server or on a
non-default port, you must also specify these values. The default values
are as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
openoffice.server.host=127.0.0.1
openoffice.server.port=8100
\end{verbatim}

By default, when Liferay uses OpenOffice or LibreOffice to perform
conversions, it uses a cache. The first time a document is converted, a
copy is saved in the Liferay temp folder
\texttt{/liferay/document\_conversion/}. When Liferay receives a
conversion request, it checks this folder to see if the converted
document already exists. If the converted document is found, Liferay
returns it to the user. Otherwise, it performs a fresh conversion and
saves a copy in the temp folder. If the cache is turned off, Liferay
will always regenerate the file regardless of whether a previously
existing conversion already exists in the temp folder. You can turn the
cache off by setting the following property:

\begin{verbatim}
openoffice.cache.enabled=false
\end{verbatim}

To configure Liferay to use OpenOffice/LibreOffice from the Control
Panel, navigate to the \emph{Server Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{External
Services} page and check the \emph{Enabled} box for OpenOffice. If
OpenOffice/LibreOffice is running on a non-default port, you must also
specify the port number. By default, OpenOffice runs on port 8100, which
is the default port in the Control Panel. If you have something else
running on this port, find an open port and specify it both in the
command to start OpenOffice/LibreOffice in server mode and on the
Control Panel's External Services configuration page. When you are
finished, click \emph{Save}. Now Liferay can perform many types of
document conversions.

\subsubsection{ImageMagick
configuration}\label{imagemagick-configuration}

Once you've installed the correct version of
\href{http://www.imagemagick.org}{\emph{ImageMagick}} for your operating
system, which should include the installation of Ghostscript, you need
to configure Liferay to use ImageMagick. You can do this either in your
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file or from the Control Panel. To enable
ImageMagick in your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file, add the
following lines and make sure the search path points to the directories
for the ImageMagick and Ghostscript executables. You may also need to
configure the path for fonts used by Ghostscript when in Mac or Unix
environments.

\begin{verbatim}
imagemagick.enabled=true
imagemagick.global.search.path[apple]=
  /opt/local/bin:/opt/local/share/ghostscript/fonts:/opt/local/share/fonts/urw-fonts
imagemagick.global.search.path[unix]=
  /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts:/usr/local/share/fonts/urw-fonts
imagemagick.global.search.path[windows]=
  C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick
\end{verbatim}

To enable ImageMagick from the Control Panel, navigate to the
\emph{Server Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{External Services} page, check the
\emph{Enabled} checkbox for ImageMagick and verify the paths to the
ImageMagick and Ghostscript executables are correct.

Note that some older versions of ImageMagick are unable to properly run
with Liferay. If this is the case, update to the latest version
(ImageMagick 6.7.9-6 2012-09-25 Q16 or later). To check for the latest
ImageMagick versions, visit
\url{http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php}. See
\url{http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-30291} for information on
efforts to identify incompatible application versions with Liferay.

\subsubsection{Xuggler configuration}\label{xuggler-configuration}

Once you've installed the correct version of
\href{http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler}{\emph{Xuggler}} for your operating
system, you need to configure your environment variables. Depending on
where you installed Xuggler, a configuration similar to the following
should work on Unix-like systems:

\begin{verbatim}
export XUGGLE_HOME=/usr/local/xuggler
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$XUGGLE_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$XUGGLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
\end{verbatim}

Once your environment variables are set up correctly, you can configure
Liferay to use Xuggler either in your \texttt{portal-properties} file or
from the Control Panel. If you'd like to use your portal-ext.properties
file, just add the following line:

\begin{verbatim}
xuggler.enabled=true
\end{verbatim}

To configure Liferay to use Xuggler in the Control Panel, navigate to
the \emph{Server Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{External Services} page and
check \emph{Enabled}. That's it! You've successfully configured the
Documents and Media library to use Xuggler for audio and video files.

\subsection{Script}\label{script}

Liferay includes a scripting console which lets administrators execute
migration or management code instantly. Several scripting languages are
supported, including JavaScript, Groovy, Python, Ruby and Beanshell.
This guide contains a
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/6-2/using-scripting-for-advanced-flexibility}{chapter}
that explains how to use Liferay's scripting console and provides some
examples. For further information about Liferay's APIs, please refer to
the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop}{Liferay
Developer Network}, \href{http://manning.com/sezov}{\emph{Liferay in
Action}}, or Liferay's
\href{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs}{Javadocs}.

\subsection{Shutdown}\label{shutdown}

If you ever need to shut down your Liferay Portal server while users are
logged in, you can use the Shutdown tab to inform your logged-in users
of the impending shutdown. You can define the number of minutes until
the shutdown and a custom message that will be displayed.

Users will see your message at the top of their portal pages for the
duration of time you specified. When the time expires, all portal pages
will display a message saying the portal has been shut down. At this
point, the server will need to be restarted to restore access. Next,
let's examine how to manage multiple portal instances.

\section{Portal Instances}\label{portal-instances}

Liferay Portal allows you to run more than one portal instance on a
single server. The Portal Instances section of the Control Panel appears
under the Configuration heading. This section lets you manage multiple
portal instances from a single Liferay installation. Each portal
instance's data is kept separate from every other portal instance's
data. All portal data, however, is kept in the same database.

Each portal instance requires its own domain name. Liferay directs users
to the proper portal instance based on this domain name. So before you
configure an instance, configure its domain name in your network first.
When you're ready to add an instance, click the \emph{Add} button here.

You'll be prompted for four fields and a check box:

\textbf{Web ID:} A general convention is to use the domain name for
this. It's a user-generated ID for the instance.

\textbf{Virtual Host:} Put the domain name you configured in your
network here. When \textbf{users} are directed to your Liferay server
via this domain name, Liferay will then be able to send them to the
proper portal instance.

\textbf{Mail Domain:} Enter the domain name for the mail host for this
instance. Liferay will use this to send email notifications from the
portal.

\textbf{Max Users:} Enter the maximum numbers of user accounts you would
like your portal instance to support.

\textbf{Active:} Use this check box to choose whether to create an
active or an inactive portal instance.

When you are finished filling out the form, click \emph{Save}. Now
navigate to the portal using your new domain name. You will see you are
brought to what looks like a clean install of Liferay. This is your new
portal instance which can now be configured any way you like.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-17}

In this chapter, we examined how to configure Liferay's portal settings.
We looked at the different authentication options provided by Liferay.
You can configure Liferay so that users can authenticate via LDAP, CAS,
Facebook, NTLM, OpenID, OpenSSO, or SiteMinder. We also examined some
general configuration options for the portal users, such as reserved
credentials and default user associations.

Next, we learned how to configure mail host names, email notifications,
content sharing, identification information, and portal display
settings. We showed how to add custom fields to various portal entities
such as users, pages, documents, wiki articles, message board posts, and
more.

We also saw how to view and configure overall server settings. We saw
how to view the memory currently being used by the server, as well as
how to initiate garbage collection, a thread dump, search engine
re-indexing and the clearing of various caches. We learned how to debug
parts of the portal by changing log levels and by viewing the various
properties defined in the portal. We learned how to properly notify
users that the portal is about to shut down and how to set up external
services like OpenOffice integration.

Lastly, we looked at how to create multiple portal instances on a single
installation of Liferay and we showed how to view currently installed
plugins. We hope this information helps you become an effective Liferay
Portal Administrator.

\chapter{Installation and Setup}\label{installation-and-setup}
\pagestyle{headings}

Liferay Portal is one of the most flexible applications on the market
today with regard to application server environments. It supports a wide
variety of application servers, freeing you to use the Java application
server you think is best. Liferay also scales very well: you can install
Liferay Portal on everything from a shared hosting account to a
multi-node cluster running a commercial application server and on
everything in between. In fact, Liferay is used successfully in all of
these scenarios every day.

You'll find that because Liferay is extremely flexible in its deployment
options, it is also easy to install. If you already have an application
server, you can use the tools for deployment that came with your
application server. If you don't have an application server, Liferay
provides several application server bundles from which to choose. These
are pre-configured application servers with Liferay already installed in
them. They're very easy to install and with a small amount of
configuration can be made into production-ready systems.

The installation steps vary slightly according to your Liferay edition,
so we'll be sure to let you know when they are different.

\section{Editions of Liferay}\label{editions-of-liferay}

Liferay ships in two editions: one for the community and one for
enterprise subscribers. The community edition is the same Liferay Portal
that has been available for years: frequently updated and bursting with
the latest features, the Community Edition of Liferay Portal is offered
for free under the Lesser GNU public license, a free software license
with one important exception. This license gives you the flexibility to
link Liferay with your own code in your portlet, theme, hook, layout,
Ext or web plugins, no matter what license you use for your code. If,
however, you modify Liferay directly, those modifications need to be
released as free software under the terms of the license. The best way,
of course, to do this is to contribute it back to the Liferay community.
This is really the best of both worlds: you have the freedom use any
license (or no license) if you use plugins, but if you modify Liferay
directly, the community receives the benefits of any enhancements that
you've made.

Liferay for enterprise subscribers is a supported version of Liferay
Portal for the enterprise. The subscription and support package allows
organizations to build their portals on a stable version of the product
that is offered over an extended period of time. It's the best wayfor
you to develop, deploy, and maintain your Liferay solution. It includes

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Liferay support
\item
  Updates
\item
  Fix Packs
\item
  Cloud Services
\item
  Liferay Portal Enterprise Edition
\end{itemize}

Now let's learn how to get a copy of Liferay Portal.

\section{Obtaining Liferay Portal}\label{obtaining-liferay-portal}

The Liferay community can download Liferay Portal from our web site at
\url{http://www.liferay.com}. Click the \emph{Downloads} link at the top
of the page, and you'll see multiple options for getting a copy of
Liferay, including our convenient bundles or a \texttt{.war} package for
installation on your application server of choice.

Liferay enterprise subscribers can download Liferay from the Customer
Portal. You have a choice of the same open source app server bundles as
community members, plus a few commercial alternatives, in addition to
the \texttt{.war} package for manual installation.

So what is a bundle anyway? A bundle is an application server with
Liferay preinstalled. This is the most convenient way to install
Liferay. Liferay is bundled with a number of application servers; all
you need to do is choose the one that best fits your needs. If you don't
currently have an application server, you may want to start with the
Tomcat bundle, as Tomcat is one of the smallest and most straightforward
bundles to configure. If you have an open source application server
preference, choose the server you prefer from the available Liferay
Portal bundles. All the bundles ship with a Java Runtime Environment for
Windows; if you are using a different operating system, you must have a
JDK (Java Development Kit) installed prior to launching Liferay Portal.

Please note that Liferay is not able to provide application server
bundles for proprietary application servers such as WebLogic or
WebSphere, because the licenses for these servers don't allow for
redistribution. Liferay Portal, however, runs just as well on these
application servers as it does on the others. A \texttt{.war} file and
dependency \texttt{.jar}s are provided for proprietary application
servers, and you'll need to follow a procedure to install Liferay on
them.

Once you have Liferay, you can then plan out your installation. This is
a two-step process: first, determine if you need Liferay Portal Security
turned on, and second, install Liferay Portal, by using a bundle or by
installing it manually on your existing app server. Next, we'll go over
the steps it takes to install Liferay Portal.

\section{Liferay installation
overview}\label{liferay-installation-overview}

Before we begin, it's important to go over the various facets of the
installation. They are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Create your database.
\item
  Determine whether you want to use the Liferay managed data source or a
  data source managed by your application server. The Liferay managed
  data source is recommended.
\item
  Gather credentials for sending email notifications to users. Liferay
  supports a JNDI mail session as well as its built-in mail session.
\item
  Install a Liferay bundle or on an existing application server
  according to the instructions for your application server (see below).
\item
  Determine whether you'll use Marketplace or other third party
  applications. If you will, you should enable Liferay's Plugin Access
  Control List (PACL).
\end{enumerate}

We'll go through the steps in order, so first we'll look at the Liferay
database.

\section{Liferay's database}\label{liferays-database}

The recommended way of setting up your Liferay database also happens to
be the simplest. Liferay Portal takes care of just about everything. The
only thing you need to do is create a blank database encoded for
character set UTF-8. The reason for this is that Liferay is a
multilingual application, and needs UTF-8 encoding to display all the
character sets it supports.

Next, create an ID for accessing this database and grant it all
rights--including the rights to create and drop tables--to the blank
Liferay database. This is the ID you'll use to connect to the Liferay
database, and you'll configure it later either in your application
server or in Liferay's properties file so that Liferay can connect to
it.

One of the first things Liferay Portal does when you bring it up for the
first time is create the tables it needs in the database you just
created. It does this automatically, complete with indexes.

If you create your database and grant a user ID full access to it,
Liferay can use that user ID to create its indexes and tables
automatically. This is the recommended way to set up Liferay, as it
allows you to take advantage of Liferay's ability to maintain its
database automatically during upgrades or through various plugin
installs that create tables of their own. It is by far the best way to
set up your Liferay installation.

If you'll be setting up Liferay's database with the recommended
permissions, you can skip to the next section.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} The below instructions are not the recommended set up for
Liferay installations, but the procedure is documented here so
enterprises with more restrictive standards can install Liferay with
more strict--but suboptimal--database settings. If it's at all possible,
Liferay recommends that you use the automatic method as documented above
instead of the procedure outlined below.

\end{roundedframe}
Even though Liferay can create its database automatically, some
enterprises prefer \emph{not} to allow the user ID configured in an
application server to have the permissions over the database necessary
for Liferay and its plugins to maintain their tables. For these
organizations, Select, Insert, Update and Delete are the only
permissions allowed so we will go over how to set up the database
manually. If your organization \emph{is} willing to grant the Liferay
user ID permissions to create and drop tables in the database--and this
is the recommended configuration--by all means, use the recommended
configuration.

Creating the database is simple: grant the ID Liferay uses to access the
database full rights to do anything to the database. Then install
Liferay and have it create the database. Once the database is created,
remove the permissions for creating tables and dropping tables from the
user ID.

There are some caveats to running Liferay like this. Many Liferay
plugins create new tables when they're deployed. In addition to this,
Liferay has an automatic database upgrade function that runs when
Liferay is upgraded. If the user ID that accesses the database doesn't
have enough rights to create/modify/drop tables in the database, you
must grant those rights to the ID before you deploy one of these plugins
or start your upgraded Liferay for the first time. Once the tables are
created or the upgrade is complete, you can remove those rights until
the next deploy or upgrade. Additionally, your developers may create
plugins that need to create their own tables. These are just like
Liferay's plugins that do the same thing, and they cannot be installed
if Liferay can't create these tables automatically. If you wish to
install these plugins, you will need to grant rights to create tables in
the database before you attempt to install them.

Once you have your database ready, you can install Liferay on your
server.

\section{Liferay Marketplace}\label{liferay-marketplace}

The Liferay Marketplace is an integral part of the Liferay Portal
experience. Starting with Liferay Portal 6.2, the Marketplace plugin is
required to be installed alongside Liferay Portal. The Marketplace
plugin enables a host of features that extend beyond just access to the
online Liferay Marketplace. Some of the key features the Marketplace
plugin enables are:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Liferay Marketplace: direct access to our online Marketplace
\item
  App Manager: ability to install, uninstall, and update apps
\item
  Bundled Apps: easily manage apps that may come bundled with your
  Liferay Portal
\item
  Developer Apps: ability to manage apps that you're developing
\item
  License Manager: streamlined license management for your Liferay
  Portal and apps
\end{itemize}

The portal installation process attempts to deploy and register the
Marketplace plugin automatically. If your environment supports/allows 1)
hot deploy and 2) full database rights, the automatic deploy process
takes care of itself. Many companies (especially in a production
environment), however, limit automated processes and/or database access.
Additionally, certain application servers (eg., WebSphere) do not
support hot deploy, so you may need to deploy the Marketplace plugin
manually. Depending on your environment's restrictions, you may need to
follow one or more of the steps below to install the Marketplace plugin
properly.

\subsection{Server is Firewalled without Access to the
Internet}\label{server-is-firewalled-without-access-to-the-internet}

Your server may be behind a firewall that prevents access to the
Internet, or your security policy may not allow direct download and
installation from the Internet. In these cases, you have 2 options:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  From an Internet-enabled computer, download the Marketplace
  plugin.\footnote{\url{https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/download}} Then
  allow Liferay to auto deploy it by dropping the downloaded .lpkg file into
  the Liferay deploy folder.
\item
  From an Internet-enabled computer, download the Marketplace plugin.
  Then use the Liferay App Manager to deploy the plugin.
\end{enumerate}

Detailed instructions can be found under
\href{https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/plugin-management-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-14-en}{Installing
Plugins Manually}.

\subsection{Application Server Does Not Support Hot
Deploy}\label{application-server-does-not-support-hot-deploy}

If your application server does not support hot deploy, you can't
leverage Liferay's auto deploy feature. You can, however, manually
deploy the plugin in two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Use Liferay's tools to pre-deploy the file.
\item
  Then use your app server's tools to do the actual deployment.
\end{enumerate}

This is because Liferay makes deployment-time modifications to the
plugins right before they are actually deployed to the application
server. Detailed instructions can be found under
\href{https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/plugin-management-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-14-en}{Deploy
Issues for Specific Containers}.

\subsection{Limited Database Access}\label{limited-database-access}

Some production environments do not have the necessary database
permissions for Life\-ray and its plugins to maintain their tables. In
these cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Grant the ID Liferay uses to access the database temporary full rights
  to the database.
\item
  Install Liferay and have it create the database.
\item
  Once the database is created, remove the permissions for creating
  tables and dropping tables from the user ID.
\end{enumerate}

Detailed instructions are available.\footnote{\url{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/6-2/liferays-database}}
It should be noted that most sophisticated Liferay apps--not just the
Marketplace plugin--require new tables when deployed. If your
environment restricts database access, you may need to repeat the above
steps whenever you deploy a new app to the Liferay Portal.

\section{Liferay Home}\label{liferay-home}

Liferay Portal uses a special folder defined as \emph{Liferay Home}.
This folder is usually one folder higher than the location of the
application server itself. This is why the bundles place the application
server one folder in from the bundle's root folder.

If Liferay is unable to create the resources it needs in this folder or
if it finds itself running on certain application servers, it creates a
folder called \texttt{liferay} in the home folder of the user ID that is
running Liferay, and that becomes Liferay Home.

The home folder is important to the operation of Liferay. The
aforementioned folders (\texttt{data} and \texttt{deploy}) are created
there, and Liferay's properties configuration files are also stored
there.

We recommend using the setup wizard to configure your database and mail
sessions when you first configure Liferay. This creates a
\texttt{portal-setup-wizard.properties} file where all the settings from
the setup wizard are stored. When you begin customizing your portal's
configuration, we recommend you create a separate properties file for
that, called \texttt{portal-ext.properties}. This allows you to keep
your server configuration properties separate from core properties like
your database and mail server configurations. All the possible
properties that can be placed in this file are documented in
\href{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc}{our reference
documentation}.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} To avoid using the setup wizard so you can configure
everything manually from a \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file, you must
disable the Setup Wizard by specifying
\texttt{setup.wizard.enabled=false} in the
\texttt{portal-ext.properties}. Also, note that property values in
\texttt{portal-setup-wizard.properties} (the file created in Liferay
Home by the Setup Wizard) override property values in
\texttt{portal-ext.properties}.

\end{roundedframe}
Let's move on and discuss Liferay Portal security.

\section{Configuring Liferay Portal
Security}\label{configuring-liferay-portal-security}

As you probably know, Liferay Marketplace is an online store for
obtaining applications that run on the Liferay Portal platform. These
applications are provided not only by Liferay, but also by partners and
independent developers who want you to install and use their
applications on your server. Many of these applications are excellent,
and we recommend that you try them out for yourself.

Because many of the applications on Marketplace are \emph{not} provided
by Liferay, however, there's an issue of trust: how do you know these
applications are doing what they're advertised to do? There is a vetting
process that they go through before they're allowed on Marketplace, but
if the source code is not provided, there's no way for even Liferay to
know if an app has been properly represented. For this reason, Liferay
Portal implements a security layer we call the Portal Access Control
List, or PACL.

PACL forces an application to declare up front the functions from
Liferay's APIs that it calls. Anything that's not declared is not
allowed to run. It's similar to what you might see on your mobile phone
when you install an app: you get to see the Liferay API functions the
app uses, and then you can decide if you want to install that app based
on the permissions it requires. This way, you see right away what portal
data that app can access, and the app can do nothing else: you're
protected--if you have PACL enabled. So if you plan to use apps
downloaded from Marketplace, it's important to make sure PACL is
enabled.

By default, Liferay's bundles have PACL turned off. The reason for this
is that there is a small performance penalty for having PACL enabled.
Since the only reason to have PACL enabled is to install untrusted third
party apps from Marketplace (and not everybody does that), we decided to
leave PACL turned off by default, so that your portal performs as fast
as possible.

All of this is to say: if you intend to use Marketplace apps, please
enable PACL. Later in this chapter, there are sections for all the app
servers Liferay supports. Each of those sections has a subsection that
explains how to enable Java security for that app server, which is a
prerequisite for enabling PACL. Once you have Java security enabled,
PACL can be enabled by adding one line to your
\texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} or
\texttt{por\-tal-set\-up-wiz\-ard.pro\-per\-ties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
portal.security.manager.strategy=liferay
\end{verbatim}

Save the file and if Liferay is running, restart it. Your portal is now
configured to check PACL-enabled Marketplace apps against their declared
permissions.

Next, you'll make sure Liferay is configured properly for your network.

\section{Choosing IPv4 or IPv6}\label{choosing-ipv4-or-ipv6}

Liferay Portal supports both the IPv4 and IPv6 address formats, though
by default, Liferay uses IPv4 addresses. If you're on an IPv6 network,
you'll need to change the configuration. If you'd like more information
on the basics of these protocols, you can check out the
reason\footnote{\url{http://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/}} for using IPv6
addresses, and its technical
details.\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6}}

To configure your portal to validate IPv6 addresses, you must complete a
few simple steps. First, assuming you're using the Tomcat app server for
your portal, navigate to the \texttt{\$\{TOMCAT\_HOME\}/bin/setenv.bat}
file and set 

\begin{verbatim}
-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=false
\end{verbatim}

in \texttt{CATALINA\_OPTS}. Then, create a \texttt{portal-ext.properties}
file in your portal's home directory (if necessary) and set the
\texttt{tunnel.servlet.hosts.allowed} property to the target hosts you
want to allow (e.g., \emph{0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1}).

Now that you understand all the prerequisites for installing Liferay
Portal, let's go ahead and get it done! First we'll go over installing
Liferay from a bundle, and after this we'll provide instructions for
installing Liferay manually on all the application servers it supports.

\section{Installing a bundle}\label{installing-a-bundle}

Liferay bundles contain the same directory structure regardless of
application server. The top-level folder is named for the release of
Liferay. This folder is called \emph{Liferay Home}, and we refer to it
thoughout this documentation.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/02-bundle-directory-structure.png}
\caption{\\Figure 18.1: Bundle directory structure}
\end{figure}

Inside this folder, there are folders for various purposes:

\textbf{Data:} This folder is used to store the embedded HSQL database
the bundles use, as well as the configuration and data for the
Jackrabbit JSR-170 content repository and the Lucene search index. It
also contains the base directory where the OSGi framework can persist
any of its operating files.

\textbf{Deploy:} Plugins that can be copied into this folder, and
Liferay then deploys them. It is also used by Liferay Marketplace and
Liferay's graphical plugin installer utility. This folder is created 
the first time Liferay Portal starts. 

\textbf{{[}Application Server{]}:} The name of this folder is different
depending on the bundle you've downloaded. This folder contains the
application server in which Liferay has been installed.

In addition to Liferay Portal itself, bundles are shipped with a number
of plugins already installed:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/using-workflow}{kaleo-web:}
  Liferay's workflow engine
\item
  \href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/leveraging-the-liferay-marketplace}{marketplace:}
  Interface to Liferay Marketplace
\item
  \href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/touring-liferay-portals-user-interface}{notifications:}
  App that provides in-browser notifications for users
\item
  \href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/opensocial-gadgets}{opensocial:}
  Allows deploying OpenSocial gadgets to Liferay Portal
\item
  \href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/importing-resources-with-your-themes}{resources-importer-web:}
  Imports theme resources with theme plugins
\item
  \href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/liferay-sync}{sync-web:}
  Allows Liferay Sync to connect to this installation to keep Documents
  and Media folders synchronized. You must have this plugin installed if
  you want to use Liferay Sync Mobile or Desktop.
\item
  web-forms: App that allows users to create forms users can fill out.
  The results are then emailed to a specified email address.
\item
  welcome-theme: A default website that gives new users a tour of what
  Liferay Portal has to offer.
\item
  \href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/managing-events-and-calendar-resources-with-liferays-c}{calendar:}
  Liferay's calendar application. This used to be built-in, and is now a
  plugin, so it's included by default.
\end{itemize}

If you are an enterprise subscriber, the welcome theme is not included,
and you receive a few more plugins:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-1/kaleo-designer}{kaleo-designer-portlet:}
  Subscriber plugin that offers a graphical interface for creating Kaleo
  workflows.
\item
  \href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-1/kaleo-forms-defining-business-processes}{kaleo-forms-portlet:}
  Subscriber plugin that allows attaching forms to workflows.
\end{itemize}

Getting a Liferay bundle up and running is as easy as uncompressing the
archive, copying a JDBC driver, and then starting the application
server. Let's use the Tomcat bundle as an example:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Unzip the bundle to a location of your choice.
\item
  If you're setting up Liferay to be an actual server, copy your
  database's JDBC driver \texttt{.jar} to \texttt{{[}Tomcat{]}/lib/ext}
  (see the setup wizard section below). If you're setting up Liferay for
  demo purposes, you can skip this step.
\item
  Start Tomcat in the same way you would if you had downloaded it
  manually. Tomcat is launched by way of a script which is found in its
  \texttt{bin} folder. If you drop to a command prompt and go to this
  folder, you can launch Tomcat via the following command on Windows:

  startup
\end{enumerate}

or the following command on Linux/Mac/Unix:

\begin{verbatim}
./startup.sh
\end{verbatim}

The Liferay/Tomcat bundle then launches. If you are on Windows, another
command prompt window appears with Tomcat's console in it. If you are on
Linux, you can see the Tomcat console by issuing the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
tail -f ../logs/catalina.out
\end{verbatim}

Once Tomcat has started, it automatically launches a web browser that
displays Liferay's setup wizard. If for some reason your browser doesn't
load the wizard, launch your web browser and then go to
\url{http://localhost:8080}.

Liferay CE ships with a sample web site that showcases Liferay's
features. It contains many links describing the features of Liferay that
we cover in detail throughout this book.

If you're installing Liferay on your own machine to explore its
features, you likely want to leave the sample site there so you can
examine it. If, however, you're installing Liferay on your server to run
your own site, it's best to start with a clean system. Before running
the setup wizard, you should remove the sample data from your Liferay
installation. You must do this before running the setup wizard to get a
clean database, and it's as simple as undeploying the application that
installs the sample data.

There is one application included in the bundle that you need to remove:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  welcome-theme
\end{itemize}

To remove it, all you have to do is undeploy it. The method for doing
this differs by application server and that, of course, depends on the
bundle you have chosen. For example, on Tomcat you delete the
application folder from the \texttt{{[}Tomcat Home{]}/webapps} folder.
On GlassFish, you use the administrative console.

If you forget to undeploy the sample application before you run through
the setup wizard and connect Liferay to your real database, the sample
data is created in your database, and there isn't an easy way to clean
it out. Make sure you get the sample data undeployed before setting up
your server, or you'll have to drop your database and re-create it.
That's not such a bad thing to have to do, since it's a brand new
database. If you don't have a brand new database, you're working with an
existing installation of Liferay, and you should follow the instructions
on upgrading in chapter 18 instead of what's described here.

If you're a Liferay Portal Enterprise subscriber, you don't have the
sample site, so you don't need to worry about this. The next step is to
run through the setup wizard, which we'll cover below.

As you can see, bundles are the easiest way to get started with Liferay.
They come preconfigured with a running Liferay instance that can be used
immediately to explore all the things that Liferay can do. Bundles are
the fastest way to create full production-ready Liferay installations.
If you're using a bundle, skip to the section on the setup wizard below
to continue your installation.

Of course, it's not always possible to use a bundle. You may already
have an application server where Liferay should be installed. The bulk
of this chapter describes how to install Liferay on all the application
servers it supports, both open source and proprietary.

\section{App Servers}\label{app-servers}

When it comes time to install Liferay Portal on your server, you'll find
it's easiest to do this by starting with a bundle. But many
organizations can't do that. There may be an existing infrastructure
into which you're installing Liferay, or you may have standardized on a
particular application server. You'll be happy to know that Liferay
Portal has been designed to work well with all the leading application
servers and that it's easy and straightforward to install. But before we
get started, we need to go over a few concepts; namely, data sources and
mail sessions. These were touched on in the section on bundles above but
we'll look at them in more detail now.

\subsection{Using data sources}\label{using-data-sources}

Liferay comes bundled with its own built-in data source. It's configured
by a number of properties that are set in a properties file. By default,
the setup wizard asks you for the necessary values and creates a
configuration file that uses the built-in data source to connect to the
database.

Liferay always recommends that you use the built-in data source.
Sometimes, however, organizations prefer to use the data source provided
by their application server of choice. In this instance, a JNDI lookup
provides a handle to the data source and the application server manages
the connection pools. Liferay supports using your application server's
data source if you wish to do that.

To do this, you'll need to create your own configuration file and skip
the setup wizard. Since you'd be creating this file \emph{after} the
wizard anyway, this isn't such a big deal. We show you how to do that
after all the sections on application servers.

Since mail sessions are configured in a similar way to data sources,
we'll look at them next.

\subsection{Using mail sessions}\label{using-mail-sessions}

Liferay's default configuration looks for a mail server on the same
machine on which Liferay's running and it tries to send mail via SMTP to
this server. If this is not your configuration, you'll need to modify
Liferay's defaults. To do this, you'll use a
\texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file (see below).

In a similar fashion to databases, you have two ways to configure your
mail server:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use your application server's mail session.
\item
  Use the built-in mail session.
\end{itemize}

To use your application server's mail session, you must create it in
your application server and it should point to your mail server. Once
you've done that, you're ready to point Liferay to it. You can do this
through the configuration file or through Liferay's control panel after
it's been installed.

You now have all the background information you need. Next you need to
make your decision: will you use Liferay's built-in data source, or the
one provided by your application server? If you're planning to use the
one provided by your server, you can't use Liferay's installation
wizard, and you'll have to follow the instructions in the section below
titled Manual Configuration.

In either case, your next step is to install Liferay onto your
application server. What follows are sections for every application
server that Liferay supports. Once you have Liferay Portal installed,
the first thing you see is the setup wizard. To continue, follow the
instructions for setting up Liferay on your application server, and then
skip down to the section on the setup wizard.

Next, follow the instructions for installing Liferay on your particular
application server in the section below.

\section{Installing Liferay on an existing application
server}\label{installing-liferay-on-an-existing-application-server}

This section contains detailed instructions for installing Liferay
Portal using its .war file distribution. This allows system
administrators to deploy Liferay in existing application server
installations. It is recommended that you have a good understanding of
how to deploy Java EE applications in your application server of choice.

\subsection{Installing Liferay in five easy
steps}\label{installing-liferay-in-five-easy-steps}

There are five generic steps to installing Liferay on an existing
application server:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Obtain the Liferay \texttt{.war} file and the dependencies archive.
\item
  Shut your application server down.
\item
  Extract the dependencies to a location on your server's global
  classpath. This allows both Liferay and plugins to access these
  dependencies.
\item
  Start your application server.
\item
  Deploy the Liferay \texttt{.war} file.
\end{enumerate}

The instructions below are specific for each application server that
Liferay supports. Liferay supports a wide combination of application
servers and databases. Because of this, this section assumes MySQL as
the database, that the database has already been created, and that
you're using the setup wizard. If you're not using the setup wizard, see
the sections above for information on how to set up Liferay manually.

We also assume your application server is already installed and running
successfully. If you still need to install your application server,
please follow your vendor's instructions first.

Since Liferay uses the UTF-8 character encoding, make sure that your
application server has the Java \texttt{-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8} parameter
set before you proceed. Note that different application servers provide
different means for setting this parameter. For example, in Tomcat this
parameter goes in the \texttt{setenv.sh} or \texttt{setenv.bat} script.
For other application servers, this parameter might go in a different
script or might have to be set through an administration console.

The following instructions assume an installation on a local machine.
When installing to a remote server, substitute \texttt{localhost} with
the host name or IP of the server.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} Note that Liferay \emph{requires} JDK 6 or greater. Do not
attempt to install Liferay 6.2 on an application server that runs under
Java 5 or lower; it will not work. If you are running an application
server that ships with a JDK and that JDK is version 5 or lower, you'll
need to upgrade your application server to run current versions of
Liferay Portal.

\end{roundedframe}
Without further ado, let's get to the application servers. The first one
we'll cover is Mule Tcat. If you don't have an application server
preference, and you want support all the way down to the application
server from Liferay, then Mule Tcat is your solution. After we cover
Mule Tcat, we'll look at all the supported application servers in
alphabetical order.

\section{Installing Liferay on Mulesoft
Tcat}\label{installing-liferay-on-mulesoft-tcat}

For this section, we will refer to your Tcat server's installation
location as \texttt{{[}TCAT\_HOME{]}}. If you don't already have an
existing Tcat server, we recommend you download a Liferay/Tcat bundle\footnote{\url{http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/available-releases}}.
If you have an existing Tcat server on which you'd like to deploy
Liferay manually, please follow the steps below.

Your first step is to download the latest Liferay \texttt{.war} file and
Liferay Portal dependencies\footnote{\url{http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/additional-files}}.
The files are named according to the following conventions:

\begin{verbatim}
liferay-portal-6.2.x-[date].war
liferay-portal-dependencies-6.2.x-[date].zip.
\end{verbatim}

Next, let's get started by addressing Liferay's library dependencies.

\subsection{Dependency Jars}\label{dependency-jars}

To run Liferay Portal on your Tcat server, you first need to make some
JAR files available on Tcat's global classpath. These include the
Liferay Dependency JARs, a JDBC driver for your database, and some other
dependencies that Liferay Portal requires.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Create the folder \texttt{{[}TCAT\_HOME{]}/lib/ext}.
\item
  Extract the Liferay dependencies file and copy the \texttt{.jars} to
  \texttt{{[}TCAT\_HOME{]}/lib/ext}.
\item
  Next, you need a few \texttt{.jar} files that are included as part of
  the Liferay Tcat bundle, but are not included with Tcat. You'll have
  to download them yourself, so let's get started. Place these
  \texttt{.jar} files into \texttt{\$TCAT\_HOME/lib/ext}:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{jta.jar}: Support for Java transactions.\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/jta/index.html}}
\item
  \texttt{mail.jar}: Support for the Java Mail API.\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-138643.html}}
\item
  \texttt{persistence.jar}: Support for the Java Persistence API.\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html}}
\item
  \texttt{activation.jar}: This is an implementation of the Java
  Activation Framework.\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/jaf11-139815.html}}
\item
  \texttt{ccpp.jar}: Enables Composite Capability/Preference Profiles.\footnote{\url{http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.ccpp/ccpp/1.0}}
\item
  \texttt{jms.jar}: The Java Messaging Service.\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/docs-136352.html}}
\item
  \texttt{jutf7.jar}: Provides UTF-7 and Modified UTF-7 charsets for
  Java.\footnote{\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/jutf7/}}
\item
  \texttt{junit.jar}: Optional: lets you run unit tests.\footnote{\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/}}
\end{itemize}

Although you can get each \texttt{.jar} listed above separately, it may
be more convenient to get them by downloading the Liferay source code
and copying them from there. Once you have downloaded the Liferay
source, unzip the source into a temporary folder. You can find the
\texttt{.jar} files in \texttt{{[}LIFERAY\_SOURCE{]}/lib/development}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Make sure the JDBC driver for your database is accessible by Tomcat.
  Obtain the JDBC driver for your version of the database server. In the
  case of MySQL, use
  \texttt{mysql-connector-java-{[}version{]}-bin.jar}. Download
  the latest My\-SQL JDBC driver.\footnote{\url{http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/}}
  Copy it to \texttt{{[}TCAT\_HOME{]}/lib/ext}.
\end{enumerate}

Now that you have the necessary libraries in place, we'll move on to
configuring your domain.

\subsection{Tcat Configuration}\label{tcat-configuration}

If you're installing Liferay Portal onto an existing Tcat server, you
should be familiar with the Tcat Administration Console. The following
instructions assume you have a Tcat server with the Administration
Console and a separate, managed Tcat server instance where you'll deploy
Liferay. To find information specific to Tcat server installation and
management, see Mulesoft's Tcat
Documentation\footnote{\url{http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/TCAT/Home}}
You have to do a few things to configure your managed Tcat server instance:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Set environment variables
\item
  Create a context for your web application
\item
  Modify the list of classes/JARs to be loaded
\item
  Specify URI encoding
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/15-tcat-sign-in.png}
\caption{\\Figure 18.2: You can log in to the Tcat Administration Console
to manage your Tcat servers.}
\end{figure}

Next, you'll configure your managed Tcat instance.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  To set the \texttt{CATALINA\_OPTS} environment variable, you need to
  add a server profile. In the Tcat Administration Console, navigate to
  the \emph{Administration} tab and click \emph{Server Profiles}. Name
  the profile appropriately (\emph{Liferay 6.2}, perhaps), provide a
  description if you wish, select the workspace where you'll keep your
  profile (\texttt{/Profiles} is a logical choice), and click the
  \emph{Add Variable} button. Name it \texttt{CATALINA\_OPTS} and give
  it the following value:

\begin{verbatim}
-Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -Dorg.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.ENABLE_CLEAR_REFERENCES=false 
-Duser.timezone=GMT -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

This sets the character encoding to UTF-8, sets the time zone to
Greenwich Mean Time and allocates memory to the Java virtual machine.

Apply the profile to the Tcat server where you're deploying Liferay. To
do so, go to the \emph{Servers} tab, select the desired server, and
select your profile from the \emph{Set Profile} dropdown menu.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Create a file locally called \texttt{ROOT.xml}:
\end{enumerate}

Click your server's name to edit its configuration. Using the
\emph{Files} tab, navigate to the directory
\texttt{{[}TCAT\_HOME{]}/conf/Catalina/localhost} and upload your
ROOT.xml file. Setting \texttt{crossContext="true"} allows multiple web
apps to use the same class loader. In the content above you will also
find commented instructions and tags for configuring a JAAS realm,
disabling persistent sessions and disabling sessions in general.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Still in your server's \emph{Files} tab, open
  \texttt{{[}TCAT\_HOME{]}/conf/catalina.properties}, click the
  \emph{Edit catalina.properties} link, and replace the line:

\begin{verbatim}
common.loader=${catalina.base}/lib,${catalina.base}/lib/*.jar,${catalina.home}/lib, \
${catalina.home}/lib/*.jar
\end{verbatim}

with:

\begin{verbatim}
common.loader=${catalina.base}/lib,${catalina.base}/lib/*.jar,${catalina.home}/lib, \
${catalina.home}/lib/*.jar,${catalina.home}/lib/ext,${catalina.home}/lib/ext/*.jar
\end{verbatim}

This allows Catalina to access the dependency jars you extracted to
\texttt{[TCAT\_HOME]/\-lib\-/ext}.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  To ensure consistent use of UTF-8 URI Encoding, edit
  \texttt{{[}TCAT\_HOME{]}/conf/ser\-ver.xml} and add the attribute
  \texttt{URIEncoding="UTF-8"} where you see \texttt{re\-direct\-Port=8443},
  in the definition of your connectors (HTTP and AJP). For example:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/15-tcat-server-files.png}
\caption{\\Figure 18.3: You can edit your Tcat configuration files in the
Administration Console.}
\end{figure}

Excellent work! Now it's time to configure your database.

\subsection{Database Configuration}\label{database-configuration}

If you want Tcat to manage your data source, use the following
procedure. If you want to use Liferay's built-in data source, you can
skip this section.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Make sure your database server is installed and working. If it's
  installed on a different machine, make sure it's accessible from your
  Liferay machine.
\item
  Using the Tcat Administration Console, add your data source as a
  resource in the context of your web application specified in
  \texttt{{[}TCAT\_HOME{]}/conf/Cat\-a\-li\-na/lo\-cal\-host/ROOT.xml}:

\begin{verbatim}
<Context...>
    <Resource
        name="jdbc/LiferayPool"
        auth="Container"
        type="javax.sql.DataSource"
        driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
        url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/lportal?useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8"
        username="root"
        password="root"
        maxActive="100"
        maxIdle="30"
        maxWait="10000"
    />
</Context>
\end{verbatim}

  Note the above resource definition assumes your database name is
  \emph{lportal} and your MySQL username and password are both
  \emph{root}. You'll have to update these values with your own database
  name and credentials.
\end{enumerate}

Your Tcat managed data source is now configured. Let's move on to your
mail session.

\subsection{Mail Configuration}\label{mail-configuration}

If you want to manage your mail session within Tomcat, use the following
instructions. If you want to use the built-in Liferay mail session, you
can skip this section.

Create a mail session bound to \texttt{mail/MailSession}. In the Tcat
Administration Console, edit
\texttt{{[}TCAT\_ HOME{]}/conf/Catalina/localhost/ROOT.xml} and
configure a mail session. Be sure to replace the mail session values
with your own.

\begin{verbatim}
<Context...>
    <Resource
        name="mail/MailSession"
        auth="Container"
        type="javax.mail.Session"
        mail.pop3.host="pop.gmail.com"
        mail.pop3.port="110"
        mail.smtp.host="smtp.gmail.com"
        mail.smtp.port="465"
        mail.smtp.user="user"
        mail.smtp.password="password"
        mail.smtp.auth="true"
        mail.smtp.starttls.enable="true"
        mail.smtp.socketFactory.class="javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory"
        mail.imap.host="imap.gmail.com"
        mail.imap.port="993"
        mail.transport.protocol="smtp"
        mail.store.protocol="imap"
    />
</Context>
\end{verbatim}

Super! Your mail session is configured. Next, you need to connect
Liferay to the mail session and database connections you just created.

\subsection{Configuring your Database and Mail
Session}\label{configuring-your-database-and-mail-session}

In this section you'll specify appropriate properties for Liferay to use
in connecting to your database and mail session.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If you are using Tcat to manage your data source, add the following
  line to the \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file in your \emph{Liferay
  Home}. This points Liferay Portal to your data source:
    \begin{verbatim}
        jdbc.default.jndi.name=jdbc/LiferayPool
    \end{verbatim}

If you are using \emph{Liferay Portal} to manage your data
source, follow the instructions in the \emph{Deploy Liferay} section for
using the setup wizard.

\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  If you want to use Liferay Portal to manage your mail session, you can
  configure the mail session in Liferay Portal. After starting your
  portal as described in the \emph{Deploy Liferay} section, go to
  \emph{Control Panel $\rightarrow$Server Administration $\rightarrow$Mail} and enter the
  settings for your mail session.

If you are using Tcat to manage your mail session, add the following configuration to
your \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file to reference that mail session:

    \begin{verbatim}
        mail.session.jndi.name=mail/MailSession
    \end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}

Before you deploy Liferay Portal, let's look at configuring Portal
Access Control Lists (PACL) with Liferay on Tomcat.

\subsection{Enabling PACL}\label{enabling-pacl}

To enable PACL, you need to enable the security manager and add some
required permissions to the server policy configuration file. This
entails editing the \texttt{CATALINA\_OPTS} variable and editing the
\texttt{catalina.policy} file:

In the \emph{Administration} tab of the Tcat Administration Console,
click \emph{Server Profiles} and click the profile applied to your
Liferay Tcat server. Click the \emph{Value} field of the
\texttt{CATALINA\_\-OPTS} variable created earlier, and add the following
parameter to it:

\begin{verbatim}
`-Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy==$CATALINA_BASE/conf/catalina.policy`
\end{verbatim}

The double equals sign tells the app server to use this policy file on
top of any existing security policies.

Edit \texttt{\$TCAT\_HOME/conf/catalina.policy} and add the required
permissions:

\begin{verbatim}
    grant {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
    };
\end{verbatim}

Now you have PACL enabled and configured for your portal. Let's deploy
Liferay!

\subsection{Deploying Liferay}\label{deploying-liferay}

It's time to deploy Liferay as an exploded web archive in your
\texttt{\$TCAT\_HOME/webapps} folder. The first step is to make sure
your Tcat server is running; then follow these steps to deploy and start
Liferay.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If you are manually installing Liferay on a clean Tcat server, delete
  the contents of the \texttt{{[}TCAT\_HOME{]}/webapps/ROOT} directory.
  This removes the default home page.
\item
  In the Tcat Administration Console, click the \emph{Deployments} tab
  and select \emph{New Deployment}. Select the server where you're
  deploying Liferay and click \emph{Upload New Webapp}. Browse to the
  \texttt{liferay-portal-6.2.x-{[}date{]}.war} file you downloaded. Make
  sure you select \emph{Advanced Options} while uploading Liferay, and
  under the \emph{Name} field, type \texttt{/} to put the extracted
  Liferay into \texttt{{[}TCAT\_HOME{]}/webapps/ROOT}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/15-tcat-upload-webapp.png}
\caption{\\Figure 18.4: Upload your Liferay Portal WAR file using the
Deployments tab of the Tcat Administration Console.}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Once you've entered all the deployment details, you can select
  \emph{Deploy}. Once you see a \emph{Successful} message in the Tcat
  Administration Console, you're ready to launch Liferay Portal on Tcat!
\end{enumerate}

Now you can navigate to Liferay and follow the setup wizard.
Congratulations on successfully installing and deploying Liferay on Mule
Tcat!

\section{Installing Liferay on GlassFish
4}\label{installing-liferay-on-glassfish-4}

\emph{Liferay Home} is three folders above your GlassFish domain folder.

For example, if your domain location is
\texttt{/glassfish-4.0-web/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1},
Liferay Home is \texttt{/glassfish-4.0-web/glassfish4/}.

If you don't already have an existing GlassFish server, we recommend
that you download a Liferay/GlassFish bundle.\footnote{\url{http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/available-releases}}
If you have an existing GlassFish server or would like to install
Liferay on GlassFish manually, please follow the steps below.

Before you begin, make sure you have downloaded the latest Liferay
\texttt{.war} file and Liferay Portal dependencies.\footnote{\url{http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/additional-files}}
The Liferay \texttt{.war} file should be called
\texttt{liferay-portal-\-6.\-2.x-[date].war} and the
dependencies file should be called
\texttt{liferay-portal-de\-pen\-den\-cies-6.2.x-[date].zip}.

These instructions assume that you are running the latest supported
version of Glassfish (currently 4.0), have already configured a domain
and server, and that you have access to the GlassFish administrative
console.

Let's start out by installing the JAR files you will need.

\subsection{Dependency Jars}\label{dependency-jars-1}

Liferay depends on jar files found in the Liferay Dependencies Archive.
You should also have installed your database driver.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Navigate to the folder that corresponds to the domain in which you'll
  be installing Liferay. Inside this folder is a sub-folder named
  \texttt{lib} (e.g.
  \texttt{/glass\-fish-3.1-web\-/glass\-fish3\-/glass\-fish/\-dom\-ains/dom\-ain1/lib}).

  Unzip the Liferay dependencies archive so that its \texttt{.jar} files
  are extracted into this \texttt{lib} folder.
\item
  Make sure the JDBC driver for your database is accessible to GlassFish
  as well. Obtain the JDBC driver for your version of the database
  server. In the case of MySQL, use
  \texttt{mysql-connector-java-\{\$version\}-bin.jar}. You can download the
  latest MySQL JDBC
  driver.\footnote{\url{http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/}} Extract the
  JAR file and copy it to \texttt{lib}.
\end{enumerate}

Terrific, you have your JAR files just where you need them. Next, we'll
configure your domain.

\subsection{Domain Configuration}\label{domain-configuration}

There are a couple of modifications you need to make in your domain to
use Liferay Portal.

Before starting GlassFish, modify your domain's configuration to do the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Set the file encoding
\item
  Set the user time-zone
\item
  Set the preferred protocol stack
\item
  Prevent the application server from setting static fields (final or
  non-final) to \texttt{null}
\item
  Increase the default amount of memory available.
\end{itemize}

Modify \texttt{glass\-fish4/\-glass\-fish/\-dom\-ains/\-dom\-ain1/\-con\-fig/\-dom\-ain.xml},
merging in the following JVM options into the current lists of JVM
options within any \texttt{\textless{}ja\-va-con\-fig\textgreater{}} element
in the file:

\begin{verbatim}
<jvm-options>-Dfile.encoding=UTF8</jvm-options> 
<jvm-options>-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true</jvm-options>
<jvm-options>-Dorg.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.ENABLE_CLEAR_REFERENCES=false</jvm-options>
<jvm-options>-Duser.timezone=GMT</jvm-options>
<jvm-options>-Xmx1024m</jvm-options>
<jvm-options>-XX:MaxPermSize=512m</jvm-options>
\end{verbatim}

There may be multiple lists of JVM options in your \texttt{domain.xml}
file. For example, by default, GlassFish's
\texttt{glass\-fish4/\-glass\-fish/\-dom\-ains/\-dom\-ain1/\-con\-fig/\-dom\-ain.xml} file
contains two lists of JVM options. There's one list inside the
\texttt{\textless{}con\-fig name="ser\-ver-con\-fig"\textgreater{}} element's
\texttt{\textless{}ja\-va-con\-fig\textgreater{}} element and another inside
the \texttt{\textless{}con\-fig name\\-="de\-fault-con\-fig"\textgreater{}}
element's \texttt{\textless{}ja\-va-con\-fig\textgreater{}} element. In both
lists of JVM options, make sure that any existing options with values
such as \texttt{-Dfile.en\-cod\-ing}, \texttt{-Dja\-va.\-net.\-pre\-fer\-IP\-v4\-Stack},
\texttt{-Dorg.a\-pach\-e.cat\-a\-li\-na.load\-er.Web\-app\-Class\-Load\-er.EN\-A\-BLE\_\-CLEAR\_\-RE\-FER\-EN\-CES},
\texttt{-Dus\-er.time\-zone}, or \texttt{-XX:Max\-Perm\-Size} are replaced with
the new values listed above.

For example, replace:

\begin{verbatim}
<jvm-options>-Xmx256m</jvm-options>
\end{verbatim}

with this:

\begin{verbatim}
<jvm-options>-Xmx1024m</jvm-options>
\end{verbatim}

Edit your \texttt{domain1/config/config/server-policy.xml} and append
the following lines to the end of the file:

\begin{verbatim}
grant {
    permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
\end{verbatim}

Delete, rename, or move the \texttt{domain1/docroot/index.html} file to
another location to allow your Liferay Portal default page to be
displayed.

Next, let's get your database configured.

\subsection{Database Configuration}\label{database-configuration-1}

If you want to use GlassFish to manage your domain's data source, follow
the instructions found in this section. If you want to use Liferay
Portal to manage your data source, you can skip this section.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Start your domain's application server if it is not already running.
\item
  Go to the GlassFish console URL:
  \href{http://localhost:4848/}{http://localhost:4848}.
\item
  Under \emph{Common Tasks}, navigate to \emph{Resources} $\rightarrow$\emph{JDBC}
  $\rightarrow$\emph{JDBC Connection Pools}

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=4in]{../../images/11-glassfish31-connection-pools.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 18.5: In the GlassFish administration console,
  navigate to JDBC Connection Pools.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Click \emph{New\ldots{}}.
\item
  On the first screen (Step 1 of 2), enter the name \texttt{LiferayPool}
  for your connection pool, select the
  \texttt{javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource} resource type, and select
  your database driver vendor (e.g. \texttt{MySQL}). See figure 18.6. 

\item
  Click \emph{Next} to advance to the next step in creating your JDBC
  connection pool.
\item
  From the top of this screen (Step 2 of 2), scroll down to the
  \emph{Additional Properties} section.

\item
  Replace or add the following properties \ldots{}

  \textbf{Url:} the URL of your connection pool.

  For example,

\begin{verbatim}
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/lportal?useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8&amp; \ 
emulateLocators=true
\end{verbatim}

  Note, if you are using the above example, you should specify the name
  of your database in place of \texttt{lportal}. Likewise, if your
  database is not on the same host as GlassFish, specify your the
  database server's host name in place of \texttt{localhost}. Lastly,
  specify your database type in place of \texttt{jdbc:mysql} and use the
  correct port (3306 is for MySQL).

  \textbf{User:} the name of your database user.

  \textbf{Password:} your database user's password.
  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/11-glassfish-31-jdbc-connection-pool.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 18.6: It's easy to configure a new Glassfish JDBC
  Connection Pool. Just enter a pool name, select a resource type, and
  specify a database driver vendor.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Click \emph{Finish}.

  You should now see your \texttt{LiferayPool} connection pool listed
  under \emph{Resources} $\rightarrow$\emph{JDBC} $\rightarrow$\emph{JDBC Connection Pools}
\item
  Test your connection by selecting your \texttt{LiferayPool} connection
  pool and clicking \emph{Ping}.

  If you get a message stating \emph{Ping Succeeded}, you've succeeded
  in setting up a connection pool of your data source!
\item
  Now, you'll setup a JDBC resource to refer to the \texttt{LiferayPool}
  connection pool you just created.
\item
  Navigate to \emph{Resources} $\rightarrow$\emph{JDBC} $\rightarrow$\emph{JDBC Resources} to
  show the current JDBC resources listed by their JNDI names.
\item
  Click \emph{New\ldots{}}.
\item
  Set the JNDI name to \texttt{jdbc/LiferayPool} and select
  \texttt{LiferayPool} as the pool name.
\item
  Click \emph{OK}.
\end{enumerate}

Congratulations! You've now configured your domain's data source on
GlassFish!

\subsection{Mail Configuration}\label{mail-configuration-1}

If you want to use GlassFish to manage your mail session, follow
GlassFish's documentation on configuring a JavaMail session with a JNDI
name of \texttt{mail/MailSession}. If you want to use Liferay Portal to
manage your mail session, you can skip this step.

\subsection{Domain Configuration -
Continued}\label{domain-configuration---continued}

Let's tie up some loose ends with regards to Liferay being able to
access your database and mail session.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Shutdown your domain's application server if it is currently running.
\item
  If you are using \emph{Glassfish} to manage your data source, create a
  \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file in the \emph{Liferay Home} folder
  mentioned at the beginning of this GlassFish installation section and
  add the following to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file in your
  \emph{Liferay Home} to refer to your data source:

\begin{verbatim}
jdbc.default.jndi.name=jdbc/LiferayPool
\end{verbatim}

  Otherwise, if you are using \emph{Liferay Portal} to manage your data
  source, follow the instructions in the \emph{Deploy Liferay} section
  for using the setup wizard.
\item
  If want to use \emph{Liferay Portal} to manage your mail session, you
  can configure the mail session within Liferay Portal. That is, after
  starting your portal as described in the \emph{Deploy Liferay}
  section, go to \emph{Control Panel $\rightarrow$Server Administration $\rightarrow$Mail} and
  enter the settings for your mail session.

  Otherwise, if you are using \emph{GlassFish} to manage your mail
  session, add the following to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file
  to reference that mail session:

\begin{verbatim}
mail.session.jndi.name=mail/MailSession
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/11-glassfish-31-jdbc-connection-pool-props.png}
  \caption{Figure 18.7: GlassFish JDBC Connection Pool Properties}
  \end{figure}
Liferay will now be able to communicate with your database and mail
session.

\subsection{PACL Configuration}\label{pacl-configuration}

To enable PACL on GlassFish, you need to make some security
configurations. First, enable the security manager by editing
\texttt{glassfish/domains/domain1/config/domain.xml} and make sure it
contains the following:

\begin{verbatim}
<java-config ...>
    ...
    <jvm-options>-Djava.security.manager</jvm-options>
    ...
</java-config>
\end{verbatim}

Next, add the required permissions to the server policy configuration
file. 

\begin{verbatim}
glassfish/domains/domain1/config/server.policy
\end{verbatim}

These include the following permissions:

\begin{verbatim}
grant {
    permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
\end{verbatim}

Now let's go ahead and deploy Liferay.

\subsection{Deploy Liferay}\label{deploy-liferay}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Start your domain's application server.
\item
  Go to the GlassFish console URL:
  \href{http://localhost:4848/}{http://localhost:4848}
\item
  Click \emph{Applications} in the tree on the left.
\item
  Click \emph{Deploy}.
\item
  Under \emph{Packaged File to Be Uploaded to the Server}, click
  \emph{Choose File} and browse to the location of the Liferay Portal
  \texttt{.war} file. Enter \emph{Context Root:} \texttt{/}
\item
  Enter \emph{Application Name:} \texttt{liferay-portal}
\item
  Click \emph{OK}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/11-deploying-liferay-in-glassfish-4.0.png}
\caption{\\Figure 18.8: GlassFish provides an administrative console which
you can use to deploy Liferay.}
\end{figure}

Once you have deployed Liferay via GlassFish's administrative console,
restart GlassFish.

Your installation of Liferay Portal on GlassFish is complete!

\section{Installing Liferay on JBoss
7.1}\label{installing-liferay-on-jboss-7.1}

\textbf{Liferay Home} is one folder above JBoss's install location.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Download and install JBoss AS 7.1.x into your preferred directory.
  This directory is referred to as \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME} throughout
  this section.
\item
  Download the latest version of the Liferay Portal \texttt{.war} file.
\item
  Download Liferay's Portal Dependencies.
\end{enumerate}

Now that you have all of your installation files, you are ready to start
installing and configuring Liferay on JBoss.

\subsection{Dependency Jars}\label{dependency-jars-2}

Let's work with the dependency jar files first.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Create the folder
  \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/modules/com/liferay/portal/main}. Unzip the the
  Liferay Portal Dependencies zip file and copy the .jar files to this
  folder.
\item
  Download your database driver \texttt{.jar} file and copy it into the
  same folder. For example, for MySQL, download the MySQL Connector/J
  driver\footnote{\url{http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/}} and put
  its \texttt{.jar} file into the
  \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/modules/com/liferay/portal/main} folder.
\item
  Create the file \texttt{module.xml} in the
  \texttt{\$J\-BOSS\_HOME/\-mod\-ules/\-com/\-life\-ray/\-por\-tal/\-main} folder and
  insert the following contents:

\begin{verbatim}
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.0" name="com.liferay.portal">
    <resources>
        <resource-root path="mysql-connector-java-[version]-bin.jar" />
        <resource-root path="portal-service.jar" />
        <resource-root path="portlet.jar" />
    </resources>
    <dependencies>
        <module name="javax.api" />
        <module name="javax.mail.api" />
        <module name="javax.servlet.api" />
        <module name="javax.servlet.jsp.api" />
        <module name="javax.transaction.api" />
    </dependencies>
</module>
\end{verbatim}

  Make sure to replace \texttt{{[}version{]}} with the correct version
  of the MySQL JDBC driver. If you are using a different database,
  replace the MySQL jar with the driver jar for your database.
\end{enumerate}

Great! You have your \texttt{.jar} files ready.

\subsection{Running Liferay on JBoss 7.1 in Standalone Mode vs.~Domain
Mode}\label{running-liferay-on-jboss-7.1-in-standalone-mode-vs.domain-mode}

JBoss 7.1 can be launched in either \emph{standalone} mode or
\emph{domain} mode. Domain mode allows multiple application server
instances to be managed from a single control point. A collection of
such application servers is known as a \emph{domain}. For more
information on standalone mode vs.~domain mode, please refer to the
section on this topic in the
\href{https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Admin+Guide\#AdminGuide-Operatingmodes}{JBoss
7.1 Admin Guide}. Liferay fully supports JBoss 7.1 when it runs in
standalone mode but not when it runs in domain mode.

You can run Liferay on JBoss 7.1 in domain mode, but this method is not
fully supported. In particular, Liferay's hot-deploy does not work,
since JBoss 7.1 cannot deploy non-exploded \texttt{.war} files in domain
mode. Instead, \texttt{.war} files are in the
\texttt{do\-main/\-da\-ta/\-con\-tent} directory. Deployments are only possible
using the command line interface. This prevents many Liferay plugins
from working as intended. For example, JSP hooks don't work on JBoss 7.1
running in domain mode, since Liferay's JSP override mechanism relies on
the application server reloading customized JSP files from the exploded
plugin \texttt{.war} file location. Other plugins, such as service or
action hooks, should still work properly since they don't require JBoss
to access anything (such as JSP files) from an exploded \texttt{.war}
file on the file system.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} This does not prevent Liferay from running in a clustered
environment on multiple JBoss servers. You can set up a cluster of
Liferay instances running on JBoss 7.1 servers running in standalone
mode. Please refer to the chapter of this guide on
\href{https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/configuring-liferay-for-high-availabili-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-20-en}{Configuring
Liferay for High Availability} for information on setting up a Liferay
cluster.

\end{roundedframe}
\subsection{Configuring JBoss}\label{configuring-jboss}

Let's make some adjustments in your configuration to support using
Liferay.

You can specify the JBoss server instance's configuration in the XML
file \texttt{\$J\-BOSS\_HOME/\-stand\-a\-lone/\-con\-fig\-ur\-a\-tion/\-stand\-a\-lone.xml}. You
must also make some modifications to your configuration and startup
scripts found in the \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/bin/} folder. Lastly, you'll
need to make some modifications in your \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/modules/}.
Let's start with the changes to \texttt{standalone.xml}.

Make the following modifications to \texttt{standalone.xml}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Add the following system properties between the
  \texttt{\textless{}/extensions\textgreater{}} and
  \texttt{\textless{}man\-age\-ment\textgreater{}} tags:

\begin{verbatim}
<system-properties>
    <property name="org.apache.catalina.connector.URI_ENCODING" value="UTF-8" />
    <property name="org.apache.catalina.connector.USE_BODY_ENCODING_FOR_QUERY_STRING" 
        value="true" />
</system-properties>
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Add a timeout for the deployment scanner by setting
  \texttt{deployment-timeout="240"} as seen in the excerpt below.

\begin{verbatim}
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:deployment-scanner:1.1">
    <deployment-scanner deployment-timeout="240" path="deployments" 
        relative-to="jboss.server.base.dir" scan-interval="5000"/>
</subsystem>
\end{verbatim}

\item
  Add the following JAAS security domain to the security subsystem
  \texttt{\textless{}se\-cur\-i\-ty-dom\-ains\textgreater{}} defined in element
  \texttt{\textless{}sub\-sys\-tem xml\-ns="urn:j\-boss:do\-main:se\-cur\-i\-ty:1.1"\textgreater{}}.

\begin{verbatim}
<security-domain name="PortalRealm">
    <authentication>
        <login-module code="com.liferay.portal.security.jaas.PortalLoginModule" 
            flag="required" />
    </authentication>
</security-domain>
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Disable the welcome root of the web subsystem's virtual server default
  host by specifying \texttt{enable-welcome-root="false"}.

\begin{verbatim}
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:web:1.1" default-virtual-server="default-host">
    <connector name="http" protocol="HTTP/1.1" scheme="http" socket-binding="http"/>
    <virtual-server name="default-host" enable-welcome-root="false">
       <alias name="localhost" />
       <alias name="example.com" />
    </virtual-server>
</subsystem>        
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Insert the following \texttt{\textless{}configuration\textgreater{}}
  element inside the web subsystem element
  \texttt{\textless{}sub\-sys\-tem xml\-ns="urn:j\-boss:do\-main:web:1.1" de\-fault-vir\-tual-\-ser\-ver="def\-ault-host" na\-tive="false"\textgreater{}}.

\begin{verbatim}
<configuration>
    <jsp-configuration development="true" />
</configuration>
\end{verbatim}

  Now it's time for some changes to your configuration and startup
  scripts. Make the following modifications to your standalone domain's
  configuration script file \texttt{standalone.conf}
  (\texttt{standalone.conf.bat} on Windows) in your
  \texttt{\$J\-BOSS\_\-HOME/\-bin/} folder.
\end{enumerate}

These modifications change the following options: - Set the file
encoding - Set the user time-zone - Set the preferred protocol stack -
Increase the default amount of memory available.

Make the following edits as applicable to your operating system:

On Windows, comment out the initial \texttt{JAVA\_OPTS} assignment as
demonstrated in the following line:

\begin{verbatim}
    rem set "JAVA_OPTS=-Xms64M -Xmx512M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M"
\end{verbatim}

Then add the following \texttt{JAVA\_OPTS} assignment one line above the
\texttt{:JAVA\_OPTS\_SET} line found at end of the file:

\begin{verbatim}
    set "JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true 
    -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=$JBOSS_HOME/bin/server.policy 
    -Djboss.home.dir=$JBOSS_HOME -Duser.timezone=GMT -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
\end{verbatim}

On Unix, merge the following values into your settings for
\texttt{JAVA\_OPTS}, replacing any matching attributes with the ones
found in the assignment below:

\begin{verbatim}
    JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true 
    -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=$JBOSS_HOME/bin/server.policy 
    -Djboss.home.dir=$JBOSS_HOME -Duser.timezone=GMT -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
\end{verbatim}

Make sure you replace the \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME} references with the
appropriate directory. You'll notice some Java security options. You'll
finish configuring the Java security options in the \emph{Security
Configuration} section.

Lastly, navigate to the
\texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/modules/sun/jdk/main/module.xml} file and insert
the following path names inside the
\texttt{\textless{}paths\textgreater{}...\textless{}/paths\textgreater{}}
element:

\begin{verbatim}
    <path name="com/sun/crypto" />
    <path name="com/sun/crypto/provider" />
    <path name="com/sun/image/codec/jpeg" />
    <path name="com/sun/org/apache/xml/internal/resolver" />
    <path name="com/sun/org/apache/xml/internal/resolver/tools" />
\end{verbatim}

The added paths resolve issues with portal deployment exceptions and
image uploading problems on a Liferay Portal instance running on JBoss
7.1.x.

The prescribed script modifications are now complete for your Liferay
installation on JBoss. Next you'll configure mail and the database.

\subsection{Using the IBM JDK with
JBoss}\label{using-the-ibm-jdk-with-jboss}

If you plan on using the IBM JDK with your JBoss application server,
follow the instructions in this section. If you plan on using another
type of JDK, you can skip this section.

Currently, there are bugs in the
\texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME\-/mod\-ules\-/org\-/jboss\-/as\-/ser\-ver\-/main\-/jboss-as-\textless{}\$JBOSS\_VERSION\textgreater{}.Final.jar}
file regarding the IBM JVM
(\href{http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-39705}{LPS-39705} and
\href{http://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-9353}{JBPAPP-9353}), which
requires additional steps to ensure a successful deployment with
Liferay.

Open the
\texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/modules/com/liferay/portal/main/module.xml} file
and insert the following dependency within the
\texttt{\textless{}dependencies\textgreater{}} element:

\begin{verbatim}
<module name="ibm.jdk" />
\end{verbatim}

Next, you'll need to include a patch from Liferay's source code for one
of JBoss' default \texttt{.jar} files. This can be done by downloading
the \texttt{liferay-portal} repository's ZIP file by clicking
\emph{Download ZIP} on the repository's
\href{https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal}{GitHub page}. Once
you've downloaded the Liferay source, unzip the source into a temporary
folder. This location will be referred to as \texttt{\$LIFERAY\_SOURCE}.

In summary, you'll need to update the
\texttt{ServerDependenciesProcessor.class} file in the
\texttt{jboss-as-{[}\$JBOSS\_VERSION{]}.Final.jar} file to specify the
IBM JDK. The steps to insert the patch can be referenced below.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Copy the \texttt{jboss-as-{[}\$JBOSS\_VERSION{]}.Final.jar} file from
  \texttt{\$J\-BOSS\_\-HOME/\-mod\-ules/\-org/\-j\-boss/\-as/\-ser\-ver/\-main} to the
  \texttt{\$LIFE\-RAY\_\-SOURCE/\-tools/\-ser\-vers/\-j\-boss/\-patch\-es/\-JBP\-APP-9353/clas\-ses}
  folder.
\item
  Navigate to the
  \texttt{\$LIFE\-RAY\_\-SOURCE/\-tools/\-ser\-vers/\-j\-boss/\-patch\-es/\-JBP\-APP-\-9353/\-clas\-ses}
  directory in a command prompt and enter the following statement: 
  
  \begin{verbatim}
  jar uf jboss-as-server-{[}\$JBOSS\_VERSION{]}.Final.jar \
  org/jboss/as/server/deployment/module/ServerDependenciesProcessor.class
  \end{verbatim}

  This command inserts the \texttt{ServerDependenciesProcessor.class}
  file into the \texttt{j\-boss-as-[\$J\-BOSS\_\-VERSION].Fin\-al.jar}
  file's \texttt{org/\-j\-boss/\-as/\-ser\-ver/\-de\-ploy\-ment/\-mod\-ule} folder. You can
  reference the official documentation for updating a JAR file.\footnote{\url{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/update.html}}
\item
  Copy the \texttt{jboss-as-{[}\$JBOSS\_VERSION{]}.Final.jar} file back
  to its original
  \texttt{\$J\-BOSS\_\-HOME/\-mod\-ules/\-org/\-j\-boss/\-as/\-ser\-ver/\-main} folder.
\end{enumerate}

Lastly, you'll need to make a few changes in your
\texttt{\$J\-BOSS\_\-HOME/\-mod\-ules} directory.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Create the folder \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/modules/ibm/jdk/main}. Create
  a new file called \texttt{module.xml} in that folder.
\item
  Insert this into the
  \texttt{\$J\-BOSS\_\-HOME/\-mod\-ules/\-ibm/\-jdk/\-main/\-mod\-ule.xml} file:

\begin{verbatim}
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.1" name="ibm.jdk">
    <dependencies>
        <system export="true">
            <paths>
                <path name="com/ibm" />
                <path name="com/ibm/crypto/provider" />
                <path name="com/ibm/jvm" />
                <path name="com/ibm/jvm/io" />
                <path name="com/ibm/jvm/util" />
                <path name="com/ibm/match" />
                <path name="com/ibm/misc" />
                <path name="com/ibm/net" />
                <path name="com/ibm/nio" />
                <path name="com/ibm/nio/ch" />
                <path name="com/ibm/security/auth" />
                <path name="com/ibm/security/bootstrap" />
                <path name="com/ibm/security/auth/module" />
                <path name="com/ibm/security/util" />
                <path name="META-INF/services" />
            </paths>
        </system>
    </dependencies>
</module>
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

Your JBoss application server is now configured to use the IBM JDK.
Next, you'll learn about managing a data source with JBoss.

\subsection{Database Configuration}\label{database-configuration-2}

If you want JBoss to manage your data source, follow the instructions in
this section. If you want to use the built-in Liferay data source, you
can skip this section.

Modify \texttt{standalone.xml} and add your data source and driver in
the \texttt{\textless{}datasources\textgreater{}} element of your data
sources subsystem.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  First, add your data source inside the
  \texttt{\textless{}datasources\textgreater{}} element.

\begin{verbatim}
<datasource jndi-name="java:/jdbc/LiferayPool" pool-name="LiferayPool" enabled="true"
    jta="true" use-java-context="true" use-ccm="true">
    <connection-url>jdbc:mysql://localhost/lportal</connection-url>
    <driver>mysql</driver>
    <security>
        <user-name>root</user-name>
        <password>root</password>
    </security>
</datasource>
\end{verbatim}

  Be sure to replace the database name (i.e. \texttt{lportal}), user,
  and password the appropriate values.
\item
  Add your driver to the \texttt{\textless{}drivers\textgreater{}}
  element also found within the
  \texttt{\textless{}datasources\textgreater{}} element.

\begin{verbatim}
<drivers>
    <driver name="mysql" module="com.liferay.portal"/>
</drivers>
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

Your final data sources subsystem should look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    <subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:datasources:1.0">
        <datasources>
            <datasource jndi-name="java:/jdbc/LiferayPool" pool-name="LiferayPool"
             enabled="true" jta="true" use-java-context="true" use-ccm="true">
                <connection-url>jdbc:mysql://localhost/lportal</connection-url>
                <driver>mysql</driver>
                <security>
                    <user-name>root</user-name>
                    <password>root</password>
                </security>
            </datasource>
            <drivers>
                <driver name="mysql" module="com.liferay.portal"/>
            </drivers>
        </datasources>
    </subsystem>
\end{verbatim}

Now that you've configured your data source, the mail session is next.

\subsection{Mail Configuration}\label{mail-configuration-2}

If you want JBoss to manage your mail session, use the following
instructions. If you want to use the built-in Liferay mail session, you
can skip this section.

Specify your mail subsystem in \texttt{standalone.xml} as in the
following example:

\begin{verbatim}
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:mail:1.0">
    <mail-session jndi-name="java:/mail/MailSession" >
        <smtp-server ssl="true" outbound-socket-binding-ref="mail-smtp">
               <login name="username" password="password"/>
        </smtp-server>
        <pop3-server outbound-socket-binding-ref="mail-pop">
            <login name="username" password="password"/>
        </pop3-server>
   </mail-session>
</subsystem>
...
<socket-binding-group name="standard-sockets" 
    default-interface="public" 
    port-offset="${jboss.socket.binding.port-offset:0}">
...
<outbound-socket-binding name="mail-smtp">
        <remote-destination host="smtp.gmail.com" port="465"/>
    </outbound-socket-binding>
    <outbound-socket-binding name="mail-pop">
        <remote-destination host="pop.gmail.com" port="110"/>
    </outbound-socket-binding>
</socket-binding-group>
\end{verbatim}

You've got mail! Next, you'll make sure Liferay can connect using your
new mail session and database.

\subsection{Configuring data sources and mail
sessions}\label{configuring-data-sources-and-mail-sessions}

Now that your data source and mail session are set up, you need to
ensure Liferay Portal can access them.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  First, navigate to the Liferay Home folder, which is one folder above
  JBoss's install location (i.e. \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/..}).
\item
  If you're using \emph{JBoss} to manage your data source, add the
  following configuration to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file in
  your \emph{Liferay Home} to refer to your data source:

\begin{verbatim}
jdbc.default.jndi.name=java:jdbc/LiferayPool
\end{verbatim}

  If you're using \emph{Liferay Portal} to manage your data source,
  follow the instructions for using the setup wizard.
\item
  If you're using \emph{Liferay Portal} to manage your mail session,
  this configuration is done in Liferay Portal. That is, after starting
  your portal as described in the \emph{Deploy Liferay} section, go to
  \emph{Control Panel $\rightarrow$Server Administration $\rightarrow$Mail} and enter the
  settings for your mail session.

  If you're using \emph{JBoss} to manage your mail session, add the
  following configuration to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file to
  reference that mail session:

\begin{verbatim}
mail.session.jndi.name=java:mail/MailSession
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

Before you deploy Liferay Portal on your JBoss app server, you should
enable and configure Java security so you can use Liferay's plugin
security manager with your downloaded Liferay applications.

\subsection{Security Configuration}\label{security-configuration}

When you're ready to begin using other people's apps from Marketplace,
you'll want to protect your portal and your JBoss server from security
threats. To do so, you can enable Java Security on your JBoss server and
specify a security policy to grant your portal access to your server.

Remember, we set the \texttt{-Djava.security.manager} and
\texttt{-Dja\-va.se\-cur\-i\-ty.\-pol\-i\-cy} Java options in the
\texttt{standalone.conf.bat} file earlier in the \emph{Configuring
JBoss} section. The \texttt{-Djava.security.manager} Java option enables
security on JBoss. Likewise, the \texttt{-Djava.security.policy} Java
option lists the permissions for your server's Java security policy. If
you have not set these options, you'll need to do so before using Java
security.

This configuration opens up all permissions. You can tune the
permissions in your policy later. Create the
\texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/bin/server.policy} file and add the following
contents:

\begin{verbatim}
grant {
    permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
\end{verbatim}

For extensive information on Java SE Security Architecture, see its
specification documents.\footnote{\url{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/spec/security-spec.doc.html}}
Also, see section \emph{Understanding
Plugin Security Management}\footnote{\url{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/plugin-security-and-pacl}} on the Developer Network to learn how to
configure Liferay plugin access to resources.

\subsection{JSF Configuration}\label{jsf-configuration}

If you plan on using JSF applications in your application server, follow
the instructions below. In this section, you'll learn how to upgrade
Mojarra and Weld so your app server's versions are identical to the
versions used by Liferay Faces.

\subsubsection{Upgrading Mojarra}\label{upgrading-mojarra}

Some versions of JBoss 7.1.x are not bundled with the correct Mojarra
version necessary to use Liferay Faces. For example, JBoss AS 7.1.1
comes with Mojarra 2.1.7 in the global classpath. Since Liferay Faces
uses Mojarra 2.1.21, you'll need to download a newer version of the
\texttt{jsf-api.jar} and \texttt{jsf-impl.jar} artifacts.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Download
  \href{http://search.maven.org/\#artifactdetails\%7Ccom.sun.faces\%7Cjsf-api\%7C2.1.21\%7Cjar}{\texttt{jsf-api-2.1.21.jar}}
  and copy it to the following location:

\begin{verbatim}
$JBOSS_HOME/modules/javax/faces/api/main/jsf-api-2.1.21.jar
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Open the
  \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/modules/javax/faces/api/main/module.xml} file
  and comment out the reference to the version of the JAR that comes
  with the server. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
<!-- <resource-root path="jboss-jsf-api_2.1_spec-2.0.1.Final.jar"/> -->
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Add a reference to the new JAR in the same \texttt{module.xml} file:

\begin{verbatim}
<resource-root path="jsf-api-2.1.21.jar"/>
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Add the following module to the
  \texttt{\textless{}dependencies\textgreater{}} section:

\begin{verbatim}
<dependencies>
    ...
    <module name="com.sun.jsf-impl"/>
</dependencies>
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Download
  \href{http://search.maven.org/\#artifactdetails\%7Ccom.sun.faces\%7Cjsf-impl\%7C2.1.21\%7Cjar}{\texttt{jsf-impl-2.1.21.jar}}
  and copy it to the following location:

\begin{verbatim}
$JBOSS_HOME/modules/com/sun/jsf-impl/main/jsf-impl-2.1.21.jar
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Open the
  \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/modules/com/sun/jsf-impl/main/module.xml} file
  and comment out the reference to the version of the JAR that comes
  with the server. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
<!-- <resource-root path="jsf-impl-2.1.7-jbossorg-2.jar"/> -->
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Add a reference to the new JAR in the same \texttt{module.xml} file:

\begin{verbatim}
<resource-root path="jsf-impl-2.1.21.jar"/>
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

Congratulations! You've officially upgraded Mojarra! If you'd like to
verify that you're using the correct version of Mojarra at runtime,
download the following
\href{http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/demos\#jsf2-portlet}{demo
portlet} and add it to a portal page. You should see a bulleted list of
version info at the bottom of the portlet.

Next you'll learn how to upgrade Weld.

\subsubsection{Upgrading Weld}\label{upgrading-weld}

Some versions of JBoss 7.1.x are not bundled with the correct Weld
version necessary to use Liferay Faces. For example, JBoss AS 7.1.1
comes with Weld 1.1.5 in the global classpath. Since Liferay Faces uses
Weld 1.1.10, you'll need to download a newer version of the
\texttt{weld-core.jar} artifact.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Download
  \href{http://search.maven.org/\#artifactdetails\%7Corg.jboss.weld\%7Cweld-core\%7C1.1.10.Final\%7Cjar}{\texttt{weld-core-1.1.10.Final.jar}}
  and copy it to the following location:

\begin{verbatim}
$JBOSS_HOME/modules/org/jboss/weld/core/main/weld-core-1.1.10.Final.jar
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Open the
  \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/modules/org/jboss/weld/core/main/module.xml}
  file and comment out the reference to the version of the JAR that
  comes with the server. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
<!-- <resource-root path="weld-core-1.1.5.AS71.Final.jar"/> -->
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Add a reference to the new JAR in the same \texttt{module.xml} file:

\begin{verbatim}
<resource-root path="weld-core-1.1.10.Final.jar"/>
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

Now you're ready to deploy Liferay Portal.

\subsection{Deploy Liferay}\label{deploy-liferay-1}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If the folder \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/standalone/deployments/ROOT.war}
  already exists in your JBoss installation, delete all of its
  subfolders and files. Otherwise, create a new folder
  \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/standalone/deployments/ROOT.war}.
\item
  Unzip the Liferay \texttt{.war} file into the \texttt{ROOT.war}
  folder.
\item
  In the \texttt{ROOT.war} file, open the
  \texttt{WEB-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml} file. In this file,
  replace the
  \texttt{\textless{}module name="com.liferay.portal" /\textgreater{}}
  dependency with the following configuration:

\begin{verbatim}
<module meta-inf="export" name="com.liferay.portal">
    <imports>
        <include path="META-INF" />
    </imports>
</module>
\end{verbatim}

  This allows OSGi plugins like Audience Targeting to work properly, by
  exposing the Portal API through the OSGi container.
\item
  In the same \texttt{jboss-deployment-structure.xml} file, find the
  \texttt{\textless{}j\-boss-de\-ploy\-ment-stru\-cture\textgreater{}} tag and
  update the \texttt{1.0} number within the \texttt{xmlns} attribute to
  \texttt{1.1}.
\item
  To trigger deployment of \texttt{ROOT.war}, create an empty file named
  \texttt{ROOT.war.do\-de\-ploy} in your
  \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME/standalone/deployments/} folder. On startup,
  JBoss detects the presence of this file and deploys it as a web
  application.
\item
  Remove \texttt{eclipse\-link.jar} from
  \texttt{\$J\-BOSS\_\-HOME/\-stand\-a\-lone/de\-ploy\-ments/\-ROOT.\-war/\-WEB-INF/\-lib} to
  insure the Hibernate persistence provider is used instead of the one
  provided in the \texttt{eclipse\-link.jar}.

  Now it's time to start Liferay Portal on JBoss!
\item
  Start the JBoss application server. Now you are truly \emph{the boss}
  when it comes to deploying Liferay Portal on JBoss!
\end{enumerate}

\section{Installing Liferay on Tomcat 7}\label{installing-liferay-on-tomcat-7}

\emph{Liferay Home} is one folder above Tomcat's install location.

For this section, we will refer to your Tomcat server's installation
location as \texttt{\$TOM\-CAT\_\-HOME}. If you do not already have an
existing Tomcat server, we recommend you download a Liferay/Tomcat
bundle.\footnote{\url{http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/available-releases}}
If you have an existing Tomcat server or would like to install Liferay
on Tomcat manually, please follow the steps below.

Before you begin, make sure you have downloaded the latest Liferay
\texttt{.war} file and Liferay Portal dependencies.\footnote{\url{http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/additional-files}}
The Liferay files have the following naming conventions:

\begin{verbatim}
liferay-portal-6.2.x-[date].war
liferay-portal-dependencies-6.2.x-[date].zip
\end{verbatim}

Next, let's get started by addressing Liferay's library dependencies.

\subsection{Dependency Jars}\label{dependency-jars-3}

Liferay Portal depends on several \texttt{JAR} files found in the
Liferay Dependencies Archive. In addition to these, you need the proper
driver for your database. You can get the necessary dependencies by
following these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Create a folder named \texttt{ext} in \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/lib}.
\item
  Unzip the Liferay Dependencies and copy the .jar files to
  \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/lib/ext}.
\item
  Download the \texttt{support-tomcat.jar} file.\footnote{\url{http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|com.liferay.portal|support-tomcat|6.2.1|jar}}
  Copy it into your \texttt{\$TOM\-CAT\_HOME/\-lib\-/ext} directory. This
  \texttt{JAR} provides classes that extend some Tomcat-specific classes
  in order to support Liferay's runtime.
\item
  Next, you need to download a few third party \texttt{.jar} files that
  are included as part of the Liferay source distribution, but are not
  automatically included with Tomcat. Place these \texttt{.jar} files
  into \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/lib/ext}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    \texttt{jta.jar}: This .jar manages transactions.\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/jta/index.html}}
  \item
    \texttt{mail.jar}: This .jar implements mail.\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-138643.html}}
  \item
    \texttt{persistence.jar}: The Java Persistence API.\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html}}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Make sure your database's JDBC driver is accessible by Tomcat.
  In the case of My\-SQL, use
  \texttt{mysql-connector-java-\{\$version\}-bin.jar}. Download
  the latest My\-SQL JDBC driver.\footnote{\url{http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/}} Extract the JAR
  file and copy it to \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/lib/ext}.
\item
  There are a few other JARs that come with a typical Liferay bundle
  that you might want to download and place in your
  \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/lib/ext} folder. They include these:

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    \texttt{activation.jar}\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/jaf11-139815.html}}
  \item
    \texttt{ccpp.jar}\footnote{\url{http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.ccpp/ccpp/1.0}}
  \item
    \texttt{jms.jar}\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/docs-136352.html}}
  \item
    \texttt{jutf7.jar}\footnote{\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/jutf7/}}
  \item
    \texttt{junit.jar}\footnote{\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/}}
  \end{itemize}

  You can download each third party \texttt{.jar} listed above from the
  provided websites, then place them into your
  \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/lib/ext} directory. However, they're also
  available in the Liferay source code, so if you have access to the
  Liferay source or would like to download it for this purpose, feel
  free to copy the \texttt{.jar} files from there. Assuming your local
  Liferay source directory is \texttt{\$LIFERAY\_SOURCE}, you can get
  all the third party \texttt{.jar} files listed above from
  \texttt{\$LIFE\-RAY\_SOURCE/lib/de\-vel\-op\-ment}, with the exception of
  \texttt{ccpp.jar}, which is found in
  \texttt{\$LIFE\-RAY\_SOURCE/\-lib/\-por\-tal}.
\end{enumerate}

Now that you have the necessary libraries in place, we'll move on to
configuring your domain.

\subsection{Tomcat Configuration}\label{tomcat-configuration}

There are several configuration steps you need to complete before Tomcat
can run Liferay. Let's get started.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  First, you'll need to set the \texttt{CATALINA\_OPTS} environment
  variable. Create a \texttt{set\-env.bat} (Windows) or \texttt{setenv.sh}
  file (Unix, Linux, Mac OS) in the \texttt{\$TOM\-CAT\_\-HOME/\-bin}
  directory. Populate it with following contents:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \texttt{setenv.bat}:

\begin{verbatim}
if exist "%CATALINA_HOME%/jre@java.version@/win" (
    if not "%JAVA_HOME%" == "" (
        set JAVA_HOME=
    )

    set "JRE_HOME=%CATALINA_HOME%/jre@java.version@/win"
)

set "CATALINA_OPTS=%CATALINA_OPTS% -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 
-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
-Dorg.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.ENABLE_CLEAR_REFERENCES=false 
-Duser.timezone=GMT -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
\end{verbatim}
  \item
    \texttt{setenv.sh}:

\begin{verbatim}
CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 
-Dorg.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.ENABLE_CLEAR_REFERENCES=false 
-Duser.timezone=GMT -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
\end{verbatim}
  \end{itemize}

  This sets the character encoding to UTF-8, sets the time zone to
  Greenwich Mean Time, and allocates memory to the Java Virtual Machine.
\item
  Next, create a context for Liferay. Create a \texttt{ROOT.xml} file in
  \texttt{\$TOM\-CAT\_\-HOME/\-conf/\-Cat\-a\-li\-na/\-lo\-cal\-host}. Populate it with the
  following contents to set up a portal web application:

\begin{verbatim}
<Context path="" crossContext="true">

    <!-- JAAS -->

    <!--<Realm
        classNjame="org.apache.catalina.realm.JAASRealm"
        appName="PortalRealm"
        userClassNames="com.liferay.portal.kernel.security.jaas.PortalPrincipal"
        roleClassNames="com.liferay.portal.kernel.security.jaas.PortalRole"
    />-->

    <!--
    Uncomment the following to disable persistent sessions across reboots.
    -->

    <!--<Manager pathname="" />-->

    <!--
    Uncomment the following to not use sessions. See the property
    "session.disabled" in portal.properties.
    -->

    <!--<Manager className="com.liferay.support.tomcat.session.SessionLessManagerBase" />-->
</Context>
     Setting `crossContext="true"` allows multiple web apps to use the same class
\end{verbatim}

  loader. In the configuration above you will also find commented
  instructions and tags for configuring a JAAS realm, disabling
  persistent sessions and disabling sessions in general.
\item
  Next, make sure the libraries you added to
  \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/lib/ext} are loaded when you start the server.
  Open \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/conf/catalina.properties} and replace the
  line:

\begin{verbatim}
common.loader=${catalina.base}/lib,${catalina.base}/lib/*.jar,${catalina.home}/lib, \
${catalina.home}/lib/*.jar
\end{verbatim}

  with:

\begin{verbatim}
common.loader=${catalina.base}/lib,${catalina.base}/lib/*.jar,${catalina.home}/lib, \
${catalina.home}/lib/*.jar,${catalina.home}/lib/ext,${catalina.home}/lib/ext/*.jar
\end{verbatim}

  This allows Catalina to access the dependency jars you extracted to
  \texttt{\$TOM\-CAT\_HOME/\-lib/\-ext}.
\item
  We also need to ensure consistent use of UTF-8 URI Encoding. Edit
  \texttt{\$TOM\-CAT\_\-HOME/\-conf/\-ser\-ver.xml} and add the attribute
  \texttt{URI\-En\-co\-ding="UTF-8"} where you see \texttt{re\-di\-rect\-Port=8443},
  in the definition of your connectors (HTTP and AJP). For example:

\begin{verbatim}
<Connector port="8080" 
    protocol="HTTP/1.1" 
    connectionTimeout="20000" 
    redirectPort="8443" 
    URIEncoding="UTF-8" />
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Lastly, if you see a \texttt{support-catalina.jar} in your
  \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/webapps} directory, delete it.
\end{enumerate}

Now Tomcat is configured to run Liferay! If you want to use Liferay to
manage your database and mail session (and we recommend you do), you can
skip the next sections and move to the section titled \emph{Enabling
PACL}. Next we'll look at configuring your database with Tomcat.

\subsection{Database Configuration}\label{database-configuration-3}

If you want Tomcat to manage your data source, use the following
procedure. If you want to use Liferay's built-in data source, you can
skip this section.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Make sure your database server is installed and working. If it's
  installed on a different machine, make sure it's accessible from the
  machine with Liferay.
\item
  Add your data source as a resource in the context of your web
  application specified in
  \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/ROOT.xml}:

\begin{verbatim}
<Context...>
    <Resource
        name="jdbc/LiferayPool"
        auth="Container"
        type="javax.sql.DataSource"
        driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
        url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/lportal?useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8"
        username="root"
        password="root"
        maxActive="100"
        maxIdle="30"
        maxWait="10000"
    />
</Context>
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} The above resource definition assumes your database name
is \emph{lportal} and your MySQL username and password are both
\emph{root}. You'll have to update these values with your own database
name and credentials.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}
Your Tomcat managed data source is now configured. Next is your mail
session.

\subsection{Mail Configuration}\label{mail-configuration-3}

If you want to manage your mail session with Tomcat, use the following
instructions. If you want to use the built-in Liferay mail session, you
can skip this section.

Create a mail session bound to \texttt{mail/MailSession}. Edit
\texttt{\$TOM\-CAT\_\-HOME/\-conf/\-Cat\-a\-lin\-a/\-lo\-cal\-host/\-ROOT.xml} and configure
a mail session. Be sure to replace the example mail session values with
your own.

\begin{verbatim}
<Context...>
    <Resource
        name="mail/MailSession"
        auth="Container"
        type="javax.mail.Session"
        mail.pop3.host="pop.gmail.com"
        mail.pop3.port="110"
        mail.smtp.host="smtp.gmail.com"
        mail.smtp.port="465"
        mail.smtp.user="user"
        mail.smtp.password="password"
        mail.smtp.auth="true"
        mail.smtp.starttls.enable="true"
        mail.smtp.socketFactory.class="javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory"
        mail.imap.host="imap.gmail.com"
        mail.imap.port="993"
        mail.transport.protocol="smtp"
        mail.store.protocol="imap"
    />
</Context>
\end{verbatim}

Your mail session is configured. Next, you'll make sure Liferay can
access your mail session and database.

\subsection{Configuring your database and mail
session}\label{configuring-your-database-and-mail-session-1}

In this section you'll specify appropriate properties for connecting to
your database and mail session.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If you are using \emph{Tomcat} to manage your data source, add the
  following configuration to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file in
  your \emph{Liferay Home} to refer to your data source:

\begin{verbatim}
jdbc.default.jndi.name=jdbc/LiferayPool
\end{verbatim}

  Otherwise, if you are using \emph{Liferay Portal} to manage your data
  source, follow the instructions for using the setup wizard.
\item
  If want to use \emph{Liferay Portal} to manage your mail session, you
  can configure the mail session in Liferay Portal. That is, after
  starting your portal as described in the \emph{Deploy Liferay}
  section, go to \emph{Control Panel $\rightarrow$Server Administration $\rightarrow$Mail} and
  enter the settings for your mail session.

  Otherwise, if you are using \emph{Tomcat} to manage your mail session,
  add the following configuration to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties}
  file to reference that mail session:

\begin{verbatim}
mail.session.jndi.name=mail/MailSession
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

It's just that easy! Before you deploy Liferay Portal, you should
configure Portal Access Control Language (PACL) with Liferay on Tomcat.

\subsection{Enabling PACL}\label{enabling-pacl-1}

To enable PACL, you need to enable the security manager and add some
required permissions to the server policy configuration file. This
entails editing two files in \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME} you've already
edited:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/bin/setenv.sh} (if on Linux, Unix, or Mac
  OS) or \texttt{setenv.bat} (if on Windows) enable the security manager
  by inserting the following code into the \texttt{CATALINA\_OPTS}
  variable (inside the quotation marks):

  \begin{verbatim}
  -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=\$CATALINA\_BASE/conf/catalina.policy
  \end{verbatim}

\item
  In \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/conf/catalina.policy}, add the required
  permissions:

\begin{verbatim}
grant {
    permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

To enable the security manager on Tomcat, the server must be started
with the \texttt{-sec\-ur\-i\-ty} command line options. Shutdown your Tomcat
instance and restart it with the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
./startup.sh -security
\end{verbatim}

Tomcat reports the message \texttt{Using Security Manager} to your
terminal.

Now you have PACL enabled and configured for your portal.

\subsection{Adding Mojarra}\label{adding-mojarra}

If you'd like to use JSF applications in your Tomcat application server,
you'll need to add Mojarra. If you do not plan on using JSF applications
in your application server, you can skip this section.

The typical binary ZIP version of Tomcat does not contain any JSF
runtime JARs like Mojarra or MyFaces. This is because Tomcat is not a
Java EE Application Server like Oracle GlassFish, Oracle WebLogic, JBoss
AS, or IBM WebSphere. Also, Tomcat is not a Java EE Web Profile Server
like Apache TomEE or Caucho Resin.

There are two ways to approach using Mojarra with Tomcat: upgrading
Tomcat's context classpath or upgrading Tomcat's global classpath. Both
methods require adding/edit\-ing two JARs, which can be downloaded below:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \href{https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/com/sun/faces/jsf-api/2.1.21/}{\texttt{jsf-api}}
\item
  \href{https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/com/sun/faces/jsf-impl/2.1.21/}{\texttt{jsf-impl}}
\end{itemize}

The typical approach for using Mojarra with Tomcat is to include
\texttt{jsf-api.jar} and \texttt{jsf-impl.jar} in the
\texttt{WEB-INF/lib} folder in each JSF project. You can do this by
specifying the \texttt{jsf-api} and \texttt{jsf-impl} artifacts without
a scope, or with the scope set as \texttt{compile} (the default) in each
JSF project:

\begin{verbatim}
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsf-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.21</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsf-impl</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.21</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
\end{verbatim}

Although it is possible to install Mojarra in the Tomcat global
classpath, it will not work properly without some small modifications to
the \texttt{jsf-impl.jar} dependency. The problem stems from the fact
that the Mojarra
\href{https://svn.java.net/svn/mojarra~svn/tags/2.1.21/jsf-ri/src/main/java/com/sun/faces/config/ConfigureListener.java}{\texttt{ConfigureListener}}
class is automatically registered for all contexts under
\texttt{tomcat/webapps} because it is specified as a
\texttt{\textless{}listener\textgreater{}} in the
\href{https://svn.java.net/svn/mojarra~svn/tags/2.1.21/jsf-ri/conf/share/jsf_core.tld}{META-INF/jsf-jsf\_core.tld}
descriptor inside the \texttt{jsf-impl.jar} dependency. Additionally,
the
\href{https://svn.java.net/svn/mojarra~svn/tags/2.1.21/jsf-ri/conf/share/javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer}{META-INF/services/javax.faces.ServletContainerInitializer}
will cause the
\href{https://svn.java.net/svn/mojarra~svn/tags/2.1.21/jsf-ri/src/main/java/com/sun/faces/config/FacesInitializer.java}{FacesInitializer}
class to auto-register the \texttt{ConfigureListener} as well.
Consequently, every request issued in all contexts invokes the Mojarra
\texttt{ConfigureListener}. This can be a potential performance problem
in a webapp environment and causes incompatibilities with a portlet
environment. Therefore, it is necessary to disable automatic
registration of the Mojarra \texttt{ConfigureListener} by modifying the
contents of the \texttt{jsf-impl.jar} dependency.

To upgrade Tomcat's global classpath, follow the steps below:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Copy \texttt{jsf-api.jar} and \texttt{jsf-impl.jar} to the
  \texttt{tomcat/lib} folder.
\item
  Open a terminal window and navigate to the \texttt{tomcat/lib} folder:

\begin{verbatim}
cd tomcat/lib
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Create a temporary folder named \texttt{jsf-impl} and navigate into
  it:

\begin{verbatim}
mkdir jsf-impl
cd jsf-impl
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Extract the Mojarra \texttt{jsf-impl.jar} dependency into the
  temporary folder:

\begin{verbatim}
jar xf ../jsf-impl-2.1.21.jar
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Open the \texttt{META-INF/jsf\_core.tld} file and remove the following
  lines:

\begin{verbatim}
<listener>
    <listener-class>com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener</listener-class>
</listener>
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Remove the Mojarra servlet container initializer:

\begin{verbatim}
rm META-INF/services/javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Overwrite the Mojarra \texttt{jsf-impl.jar} dependency by creating a
  new archive:

\begin{verbatim}
jar cf ../jsf-impl-2.1.21.jar META-INF/ com/
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Remove the temporary folder:

\begin{verbatim}
cd ../
rm -rf jsf-impl/
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Follow only \emph{one} of the following sub-steps below, depending on
  preference.

  9.1 Specify the \texttt{liferay-faces-init.jar} dependency in each JSF
  project in order for the Mojarra \texttt{ConfigureListener} to be
  automatically started by Tomcat:

\begin{verbatim}
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.liferay.faces</groupId>
    <artifactId>liferay-faces-init</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.3-ga4</version>
</dependency>
\end{verbatim}

  9.2 Specify the Mojarra \texttt{ConfigureListener} as a listener in
  the \texttt{WEB-INF/web.xml} descriptor in each JSF project:

\begin{verbatim}
<listener>
    <listener-class>com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener</listener-class>
</listener>
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Specify the \texttt{jsf-api} and \texttt{jsf-impl} dependencies as
  provided in each JSF project:

\begin{verbatim}
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsf-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.21</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsf-impl</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.21</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

You've officially added Mojarra to your application server. Now you can
deploy Liferay.

\subsection{Deploy Liferay}\label{deploy-liferay-2}

It's time to deploy Liferay as an exploded web archive within your
\texttt{\$TOM\-CAT\_HOME\-/web\-apps} folder.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  If you are manually installing Liferay on a clean Tomcat server,
  delete the contents of the \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/webapps/ROOT}
  directory. This removes the default Tomcat home page. Extract the
  Liferay \texttt{.war} file to \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/webapps/ROOT}.
\end{enumerate}

Now its time to launch Liferay Portal on Tomcat!

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Start Tomcat by executing \texttt{\$TOM\-CAT\_\-HOME/\-bin/\-start\-up.bat} or
  \texttt{\$TOMCAT\_\-HOME\-/bin/\-start\-up.sh}.
\end{enumerate}

Congratulations on successfully installing and deploying Liferay on
Tomcat!

\section{Installing Liferay on Oracle WebLogic 12c (12.1.2 and
higher)}\label{installing-liferay-on-oracle-weblogic-12c-12.1.2-and-higher}

In this section, you'll learn how to install Liferay on Oracle WebLogic
12c. Since you're using Oracle WebLogic, you may wonder if Liferay
supports XA transactions. Liferay doesn't require XA transactions, but
it supports XA. Let's get acquainted with how Liferay fits in with your
current WebLogic domain.

Liferay by default defines \emph{Liferay Home} as one folder above the
domain to which you will be installing Liferay. For example, if your
domain location is
\texttt{/Or\-a\-cle/Mid\-dle\-ware/u\-ser\_pro\-jects/do\-mains/base\_do\-main}, then
your Liferay Home is \texttt{/Or\-a\-cle/Mid\-dle\-ware/u\-ser\_pro\-jects/do\-mains}.

For this section, the variable \texttt{\$WEBLOGIC\_HOME} refers to your
WebLogic server's installation \texttt{/Oracle/Middleware}.

Before you begin, make sure you have downloaded the latest Liferay
\texttt{.war} file and Liferay Portal dependencies.\footnote{\url{http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/additional-files}}
The Liferay \texttt{.war} file is called
\texttt{life\-ray-por\-tal-{[}ver\-sion{]}.war} and the dependencies file is
called \texttt{life\-ray-por\-tal-de\-pen\-den\-cies-{[}ver\-sion{]}.zip}.

These instructions assume you have already configured a domain and
server and that you have access to the WebLogic console.

If you still have the \texttt{mainWebApp} module installed, remove it
first.

Let's get started by installing the \texttt{.jar} files Liferay needs.

\subsection{Dependency Jars}\label{dependency-jars-4}

Liferay needs the driver \texttt{.jar} file applicable for your
database, as well as the \texttt{.jar} files contained in the Liferay
Dependencies Archive. They should be on your domain's global classpath.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Navigate to the folder that corresponds to the domain where you'll
  install Liferay. Inside this folder is a \texttt{lib} folder. Unzip
  the Liferay Dependencies Archive and copy the dependency \texttt{.jar}
  files to the \texttt{lib} folder.
\item
  If WebLogic does not already have access to the JDBC driver for your
  database, copy the driver to your domain's \texttt{lib} folder as
  well.
\end{enumerate}

So far so good. Your \texttt{.jar} files are in place and ready for
Liferay.

Let's proceed with configuring WebLogic.

\subsection{Configuring WebLogic}\label{configuring-weblogic}

You need to make the following adjustments in your configuration to
support Liferay:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Set WebLogic Server's memory arguments.
\item
  Set the maximum size for Java's permanent generation space.
\item
  Set the file encoding.
\item
  Enable Lucene support.
\item
  Enable AspectJ support.
\end{itemize}

You can set WebLogic Server's memory arguments in your
\texttt{setDomainEnv.{[}cmd\textbar{}sh{]}} environment script file
found in your domain's \texttt{bin} folder. For the Sun JVM, set the WLS
memory arguments for 64 bit and 32 bit architectures to
\texttt{-Xms256m -Xmx1024m} at a minimum. For all other JVMs, set the 64
bit and 32 bit WLS memory arguments to \texttt{-Xms512m -Xmx512m}
respectively.

Set the permanent generation space for 64 bit and 32 bit architectures
to \texttt{-XX:Perm\-Size=256m}.

Lastly, make sure to specify UTF-8 for Java's file encoding, by
including \texttt{-Dfile.en\-cod\-ing=UTF8} as a Java property.

If you're on Windows, for example, you'd edit your
\texttt{setDomainEnv.cmd} file and find the call to the
\texttt{commEnv.cmd} script. After this call, you'd update your memory
arguments and permanent generation space settings to be like the
following code:

\begin{verbatim}
...
if "%JAVA_VENDOR"=="Sun" (
    set WLS_MEM_ARGS_64BIT=-Xms256m -Xmx1024m
    set WLS_MEM_ARGS_32BIT=-Xms256m -Xmx1024m
) else (
    set WLS_MEM_ARGS_64BIT=-Xms512m -Xmx512m
    set WLS_MEM_ARGS_32BIT=-Xms512m -Xmx512m
)
...
set MEM_PERM_SIZE_64BIT=-XX:PermSize=256m
set MEM_PERM_SIZE_32BIT=-XX:PermSize=256m
\end{verbatim}

Later in the \texttt{setDomainEnv.cmd} file's clustering support
section, you'd set the UTF-8 file encoding by appending
\texttt{-Dfile.encoding=UTF8} to the front of the list of Java property
values, as done in the following line of code:

\begin{verbatim}
set JAVA_PROPERTIES=-Dfile.encoding=utf8 %JAVA_PROPERTIES% %CLUSTER_PROPERTIES%
\end{verbatim}

Next, you need to specify some local environment settings to support
Liferay's memory requirements, its use of the
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucene}{Apache Lucene} search engine
library, and its use of Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) with
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AspectJ}{AspectJ}.

Open the \texttt{startWebLogic.{[}cmd\textbar{}sh{]}} file from within
your domain's folder--NOT the one in your server's \texttt{bin} folder.
If you're on Windows, you'd add directives similar to those listed
below, after the \texttt{SETLOCAL} command:

\begin{verbatim}
set "USER_MEM_ARGS=-Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=512m"
set "MW_HOME=D:\Oracle\Middleware\wlserver_12.1"
set "JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -da:org.apache.lucene... -da:org.aspectj..."
\end{verbatim}

Make sure to set your \texttt{MW\_HOME} value to your WebLogic server's
location. On Linux, you'd make similar changes replacing
\texttt{\%JAVA\_OPTIONS\%} with \texttt{\$JAVA\_OPTIONS}.

Next, if you want to configure your database and/or mail session within
WebLogic, start your WebLogic server.

\subsection{Database Configuration}\label{database-configuration-4}

If you want WebLogic to manage your data source, use the following
procedure. If you want to use Liferay's built-in data source, you can
skip this section.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Select \emph{Services $\rightarrow$Data Sources.} Click \emph{New $\rightarrow$Generic Data
  Source}.
\item
  Give your data source a name, such as \emph{Liferay Data Source}. The
  JNDI name should be \texttt{jdbc/LiferayPool}.
\item
  Choose the type of database and click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Click \emph{Next} three times. You should be on the \emph{Connection
  Properties} screen. Enter the database name, the host name, the port,
  the database user name, and the password. WebLogic uses this
  information to construct the appropriate JDBC URL to connect to your
  database. Click \emph{Next}.
\item
  WebLogic prompts you to confirm the information you've specified for
  your data source.

  Depending on the database you are using, you may need to specify
  additional parameters. If you need to access previous wizard pages to
  modify information, click \emph{Back} to revisit those pages.

  When you're done specifying your configuration, click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Click \emph{Test Configuration} to make sure WebLogic can connect to
  your database successfully. When it does, click \emph{Finish}.
\item
  You will be back to the list of data sources. Notice your new data
  source has no value in the \emph{Target} column. Click on your data
  source to edit it.
\item
  Click the \emph{Targets} tab and check off the server instance(s) to
  which you wish to deploy your data source. Then click \emph{Save}.
\end{enumerate}

Next, you'll configure a mail session in WebLogic.

\subsection{Mail Configuration}\label{mail-configuration-4}

If you want WebLogic to manage your mail sessions, use the following
procedure. If you want to use Liferay's built-in mail sessions, you can
skip this section.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Select \emph{Mail Sessions} and create a new mail session which points
  to your mail server.
\item
  Give it the name \emph{Liferay Mail} and give it the JNDI name of
  \texttt{mail/MailSession} and click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Choose your server and then click \emph{Finish}.
\end{enumerate}

Now make sure Liferay can access this mail session.

\subsection{Domain Configuration -
Continued}\label{domain-configuration---continued-1}

Let's revisit domain configuration to make sure the app server can
access your data source and mail session from Liferay Portal.

Create a \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file in your Liferay Home
folder.

If you are using \emph{WebLogic} to manage your data source, add the
following configuration to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file to
refer to your data source:

\begin{verbatim}
jdbc.default.jndi.name=jdbc/LiferayPool
\end{verbatim}

If you are using \emph{Liferay Portal} to manage your data source,
follow the instructions in the \emph{Deploy Liferay} section for using
the setup wizard.

If want to use \emph{Liferay Portal} to manage your mail session, you
can configure the mail session in the Control Panel. After starting your
portal as described in the \emph{Deploy Liferay} section, go to
\emph{Control Panel $\rightarrow$Server Administration $\rightarrow$Mail} and enter the
settings for your mail session.

If you are using \emph{WebLogic} to manage your mail session, add the
following configuration to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file to
reference that mail session:

\begin{verbatim}
mail.session.jndi.name=mail/MailSession
\end{verbatim}

Before we deploy Liferay, you should enable and configure Java Security
so that you can use Liferay's plugin security manager with the Liferay
apps you download and install.

\subsection{Security Configuration}\label{security-configuration-1}

When you are ready to start using apps from Marketplace, you'll want to
protect your portal and your WebLogic server from security threats. To
do so, you must enable Java Security on your WebLogic server and specify
a security policy to grant Liferay Portal access to your server.

First, you'll grant Liferay access to your server. This configuration
opens all permissions--you can fine-tune your policy's permissions
later. Create a policy file named \texttt{web\-lo\-gic.pol\-i\-cy} in your
\texttt{\$WEB\-LO\-GIC\_HOME/wl\-ser\-ver/ser\-ver/lib} folder and add the
following contents:

\begin{verbatim}
grant {
    permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
\end{verbatim}

To enable security on your WebLogic server and direct the server to your
policy file, open the \texttt{setDomainEnv.{[}cmd\textbar{}sh{]}} file
in your domain's folder. Then set the \texttt{-Dja\-va.se\-cur\-i\-ty.ma\-na\-ger}
Java option and set the property \texttt{-Dja\-va.se\-cur\-i\-ty.po\-li\-cy==} to
the location of your \texttt{web\-lo\-gic\-.po\-li\-cy} file. You can specify both
settings on the same line like this:

\begin{verbatim}
-Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy==$WEBLOGIC_HOME/wlserver/ser\
ver/lib
\end{verbatim}

The double equals sign tells the app server to use this policy file on
top of any existing security policies.

For extensive information on Java SE Security Architecture see its
specification
documents.\footnote{\url{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/spec/security-spec.doc.html}}
Also, see \textit{Plugin Security and
    Pacl}\footnote{\url{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/plugin-security-and-pacl}}
to learn how to configure Liferay plugin access to resources.

Next you'll learn how to configure your WebLogic application server for
JSF applications.

\subsection{JSF Configuration}\label{jsf-configuration-1}

If you'd like to deploy JSF applications on your WebLogic application
server, you'll need to complete a few extra steps in your configuration
process. If you do not plan on using JSF applications in your
application server, you can skip this section. This section assumes
you're using JSF 2.1 portlets.

Complete the first section to ensure JSF applications deploy
successfully to your WebLogic application server.

\subsubsection{Configuration for Deploying JSF
Portlets}\label{configuration-for-deploying-jsf-portlets}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  To avoid a \texttt{ViewExpiredException} with Ajax, disable the
  Liferay Portal \texttt{ETag\-Fil\-ter} by adding the following property in
  the \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.etag.ETagFilter=false
\end{verbatim}

  For more information on this exception, refer to
  \href{https://issues.liferay.com/browse/FACES-1591}{FACES-1591}.
\item
  You'll need to adjust your memory settings for your environment
  variables. For your memory settings to be permanently set, they need
  to be hard-coded in the \texttt{startWebLogic.sh} script. Just above
  the definition of your home domain, add the following lines:

\begin{verbatim}
export MW_HOME=$HOME/Oracle/Middleware
export USER_MEM_ARGS="-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:CompileThreshold=8000 -XX:PermSize=128m \
-XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
\end{verbatim}

  Note that if you have many portlet WAR modules, you may need to
  increase memory. For example, the following lines reserves double the
  amount of memory:

\begin{verbatim}
export MW_HOME=$HOME/Oracle/Middleware
export USER_MEM_ARGS="-Xms1024m -Xmx2048m -XX:CompileThreshold=8000 -XX:PermSize=256m \ 
-XX:MaxPermSize=512m"
\end{verbatim}
\item
  If you're running the JSR 329 Portlet Bridge TCK, you'll need to
  include the \texttt{trin\-i\-dad-api.jar} dependency in the global
  classpath (in the \texttt{lib} folder).
\item
  In order for JSF 2.1 portlets to deploy correctly in WebLogic, the
  \texttt{WEB-INF/web\-lo\-gic.xml} descriptor must be configured to
  fine-tune how class loading takes place. For a working example, please
  refer to the
  \href{https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/3.2.x/demos/bridge/jsf2-portlet/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/weblogic.xml}{weblogic.xml}
  descriptor from a demo JSF portlet.
\item
  Due to a deficiency in the XML parser that ships with WebLogic, it is
  necessary to include a custom \href{http://xerces.apache.org/}{Apache
  Xerces} parser as a dependency. In order to include it in the proper
  position in the WebLogic classpath, the Xerces JARs are included in
  the Mojarra Shared Library. Therefore, it is necessary to add Xerces
  as a dependency in the portlet's WEB-INF/lib folder. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>xerces</groupId>
        <artifactId>xercesImpl</artifactId>
        <version>2.11.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
\end{verbatim}
\item
  If using ICEfaces, PrimeFaces, or RichFaces, all JARs related to these
  projects must exist in \texttt{WEB-INF/lib}.
\end{enumerate}

Next, you'll need to upgrade Mojarra for your WebLogic application
server. 

\subsubsection{Upgrading Mojarra}

Liferay Faces requires JSF 2.1.21. However, the version of Mojarra that
comes with WebLogic 12c is version 2.1.20. Therefore, it is necessary to
upgrade Mojarra in WebLogic by creating a new Shared Library WAR with
the updated dependencies.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Make sure your \texttt{MW\_HOME} environment variable is defined
  (completed in step 2 of the previous section).
\item
  Build the patched version of Mojarra:

\begin{verbatim}
cd liferay-faces/support
mvn -P weblogic clean install
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Copy the patched version of Mojarra over the version that was shipped
  out-of-the-box:

\begin{verbatim}
cp $HOME/.m2/repository/com/oracle/weblogic/glassfish.jsf_1.0.0.0_2-1-21/12.1.2-0-0/ \
glassfish.jsf_1.0.0.0_2-1-21-12.1.2-0-0.jar $MW_HOME/wlserver/modules/ \
glassfish.jsf_1.0.0.0_2-1-20.jar
\end{verbatim}

  Since the Mojarra API and Implementation JARs are present in the
  global classpath, \texttt{jsf-api.jar} and \texttt{jsf-impl.jar} must
  not be included in \texttt{WEB-INF/lib}.
\end{enumerate}

Now it's the moment you've been waiting for: Liferay deployment!

\subsection{Deploy Liferay}\label{deploy-liferay-3}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Start your WebLogic server if it's not already started.
\item
  Go to \emph{Deployments} and select the Liferay \texttt{.war} file
  from the file system, or click the \emph{Upload Your File(s)} link to
  upload it and then click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Select \emph{Install this deployment as an application} and click
  \emph{Next}.
\item
  If the default name is appropriate for your installation, keep it.
  Otherwise, give it a name of your choosing and click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Click \emph{Finish}. After the deployment finishes, click \emph{Save}.
  Liferay precompiles all the JSPs, and Liferay launches.
\end{enumerate}

Congratulations! You are now running Liferay on Oracle WebLogic 12c.

\section{Installing Liferay on WebSphere
8.5}\label{installing-liferay-on-websphere-8.5}

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} Throughout this installation and configuration process,
WebSphere prompts you to Click Save to apply changes to Master
Configuration. Do so intermittently to save your changes.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}
\textbf{Liferay Home} is in a folder called \texttt{liferay} in the home
folder of the user ID that is running WebSphere.

To work correctly on WebSphere 8.5, IBM's PM90932 patch must be
installed.\footnote{\url{http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM90932}}

Please also note that the WebSphere Application Liberty Profile is not
supported by Liferay.

\subsection{Preparing WebSphere for
Liferay}\label{preparing-websphere-for-liferay}

When the application server binaries have been installed, start the
\textbf{Profile Management Tool} to create a profile appropriate for
Liferay.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Click on \emph{Create\ldots{}}. Choose \emph{Application Server}.
  Click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Click the Advanced profile creation option and then click \emph{Next}.
  Why Advanced? You can specify your own values for settings such as the
  location of the profile and names of the profile, node and host. You
  can assign your own ports. You can optionally choose whether to deploy
  the administrative console and sample application and also add
  web-server definitions if you wish. Web server definitions are used
  with IBM HTTP Server. For more information about these options, please
  see the WebSphere documentation.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/websphere-01-profile.png}
  \caption{Figure 18.9: Choose the Advanced profile option to specify
  your own settings.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Check the box \emph{Deploy the administrative console}. This gives you
  a web-based UI for working with your application server. Skip the
  default applications. You'd only install these on a development
  machine. Click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Set profile name and location. Ensure you specify a performance tuning
  setting other than \emph{Development}, since you're installing a
  server for production use. Please see the WebSphere documentation for
  further information about performance tuning settings. Click
  \emph{Next}.
\item
  Choose node, server, and host names for your server. These will be
  specific to your environment. Click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Administrative security in WebSphere is a way to restrict who has
  access to the administrative tools. You may want to have it enabled in
  your environment so that a user name and password are required to
  administer the WebSphere server. Please see WebSphere's documentation
  for further information. Click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Each profile needs a security certificate, which comes next in the
  wizard. If you don't have certificates already, choose the option to
  generate a personal certificate and a signing certficate and click
  \emph{Next}.
\item
  Once the certificates are generated, set a password for your keystore.
  Click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Next, you can customize the ports this server profile uses. Be sure to
  choose ports that are open on your machine. When choosing ports, the
  wizard detects existing WebSphere installations and if it finds
  activity, it increments ports by one.
\item
  Choose whether you want this profile started when the machine starts.
  Click \emph{Next}.
\item
  WebSphere ships with IBM HTTP Server, which is a rebranded version of
  Apache. Choose whether you want a web server definition, so that this
  JVM receives requests forwarded from the HTTP server. Please see
  WebSphere's documentation for details on this. When finished, click
  \emph{Next}.
\item
  The wizard then shows you a summary of what you selected, enabling you
  to keep your choices or go back and change something. When you're
  satisfied, click \emph{Next}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/websphere-03-summary.png}
\caption{\\Figure 18.10: The Summary page shows you what you selected,
giving you the chance to go back and change something if it's not
exactly what you want.}
\end{figure}

WebSphere then creates your profile and finishes with a message telling
you the profile was created successfully. You're now ready to install
Liferay!

\subsection{Copying portal
dependencies}\label{copying-portal-dependencies}

Liferay ships with dependency .jars it needs to have on the global
classpath. These should be copied to WebSphere's global folder provided
for this purpose:

\begin{verbatim}
[Install Location]/WebSphere/AppServer/lib/ext
\end{verbatim}

If you have a JDBC database driver .jar, copy it to this location as
well. Once you've copied the .jars, start the server profile you created
for Liferay. Once it starts, you're ready to configure your database.

\subsection{Database Configuration}\label{database-configuration-5}

If you want WebSphere to manage the database connections, follow the
instructions below. Note this is not necessary if you're planning on
using Liferay's standard database configuration; in that case, skip this
section. You'll set your database information in Liferay's setup wizard
after the install.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/02-websphere-jdbc-providers.png}
\caption{\\Figure 18.11: WebSphere JDBC providers}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Start WebSphere.
\item
  Open the Administrative Console and log in.
\item
  Click \emph{Resources $\rightarrow$JDBC Providers}.
\item
  Click \emph{New}.
\item
  For name, enter the name of JDBC provider (e.g. \emph{MySQL JDBC
  Provider}).
\item
  For Implementation Class Name, enter:

\begin{verbatim}
com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlConnectionPoolDataSource
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Clear any text in classpath. You already copied the necessary
  \texttt{.jar}s to a location on the server's class path.
\item
  Click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Click \emph{Finish}.
\item
  Click \emph{Data Sources} under \emph{Additional Properties}.
\item
  Click \emph{New}.
\item
  Enter a name: \emph{liferaydatabasesource}.
\item
  Enter JNDI: \texttt{jdbc/LiferayPool}.
\item
  Everything else should stay at the default values. Save the data
  source.
\item
  When finished, go back into the data source and click \emph{Custom
  Properties} and then click the \emph{Show Filter Function} button.
  This is the second from last of the small icons under the \emph{New}
  and \emph{Delete} buttons.
\item
  Type \emph{user} into the search terms and click \emph{Go}.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/02-modifying-data-source-properties-in-websphere.png}
  \caption{Figure 18.12: Modifying data source properties in WebSphere}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Select the user property and give it the value of the user name to
  your database. Click \emph{OK} and save to master configuration.
\item
  Do another filter search for the url property. Give it a value that
  Click \emph{OK} and save to master configuration.
\item
  Do another filter search for the password property. Enter the password
  for the user ID you added earlier as the value for this property.
  Click \emph{OK} and save to master configuration.
\item
  Go back to the data source page by clicking it in the breadcrumb
  trail. Click the \emph{Test Connection} button. It should connect
  successfully.
\end{enumerate}

Once you've set up your database, you can set up your mail session.

\subsection{Mail Configuration}\label{mail-configuration-5}

If you want WebSphere to manage your mail sessions, use the following
procedure. If you want to use Liferay's built-in mail sessions, you can
skip this section.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Click \emph{Resources $\rightarrow$Mail $\rightarrow$Mail Providers}.
\item
  Click the Built-In Mail Provider for your node and server.
\item
  Click \emph{Mail Sessions} and then click the \emph{New} button.
\item
  Give it a name of \emph{liferaymail} and a JNDI name of
  \texttt{mail/MailSession}. Click \emph{OK} and save to master
  configuration.
\item
  Click \emph{Security $\rightarrow$Global Security} and de-select \emph{Use Java 2
  security to restrict application access to local resources} if it is
  selected. Click \emph{Apply}.
\end{enumerate}

Great! Now you're ready to deploy Liferay.

\subsection{Deploy Liferay}\label{deploy-liferay-4}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Click \emph{Applications} $\rightarrow$\emph{New Application} $\rightarrow$\emph{New
  Enterprise Application}.
\item
  Browse to the Liferay \texttt{.war} file and click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Leave \emph{Fast Path} selected and click \emph{Next}. Ensure that
  \emph{Distribute Application} has been checked, and click \emph{Next}
  again.
\item
  Choose the WebSphere runtimes and/or clusters where you want Liferay
  deployed. Click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Map Liferay to the root context (/) and click \emph{Next}.
\item
  Ensure that you have made all the correct choices and click
  \emph{Finish}. When Liferay has installed, click \emph{Save to Master
  Configuration}.
\end{enumerate}

You've now installed Liferay, but don't start it yet. If you wish to use
PACL, you have one more thing to configure.

\subsection{Enabling Security for Portal Access Control
Lists}\label{enabling-security-for-portal-access-control-lists}

In the administrative console, go to \emph{Security} \$rarr;
\emph{Global Security}. Check the box to enable Java 2 security, and
click \emph{Apply}. Save to the master configuration.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/websphere-05-liferay-enable-security.png}
\caption{\\Figure 18.13: Enabling security can be done by checking one
box, but it still needs to be configured.}
\end{figure}

Next, you need to configure security for the Liferay profile you
created. This requires editing a text file, which can be found nested
several folders deep in WebSphere's \texttt{profiles} directory. The
exact path depends on how you've named your profile, but it will be
something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
[profile_root]/config/cells/[cell_name]/nodes/[node_name]/app.policy
\end{verbatim}

First, in each existing \texttt{grant} section, replace the content with
\texttt{ja\-va.se\-cur\-i\-ty.All\-Per\-mis\-sion;}. Then add the following lines to
the bottom of the file:

\begin{verbatim}
grant codeBase "file:${was.install.root}/lib/-" {
  permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

grant codeBase "file:${was.install.root}/plugins/-" {
  permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

grant codeBase "file:${server.root}/-" {
  permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
\end{verbatim}

Save the file. You should now stop the profile and restart it. Once it
comes up, you're ready to start Liferay.

\subsection{Start Liferay}\label{start-liferay}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If you plan to use Liferay's setup wizard, skip to the next step. If
  you wish to use WebSphere's data source and mail session, create a
  file called \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} in your Liferay Home
  folder. Place the following text in the file:

\begin{verbatim}
jdbc.default.jndi.name=jdbc/LiferayPool
mail.session.jndi.name=mail/MailSession
setup.wizard.enabled=false
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Select the Liferay application and click \emph{Start}.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \scalegraphics{../../images/websphere-04-liferay-starting.png}
  \caption{Figure 18.14: While Liferay is starting, WebSphere displays
  this spinny little graphic. Don't watch it too closely, or you might
  get hypnotized.}
  \end{figure}
\item
  In the setup wizard, select and configure your database type. Click
  \emph{Finish} when you're done.

  Liferay then creates the tables it needs in the database.
\end{enumerate}

Congratulations! You've installed Liferay on WebSphere!

\section{Using Liferay's setup
wizard}\label{using-liferays-setup-wizard}

To make it easy to configure Liferay optimally for your use, the first
thing you see when browsing to your newly installed Liferay bundle is a
setup wizard. This gives you a convenient way to configure Liferay for
your purposes.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/setup-wizard-1.png}
\caption{\\Figure 18.15: Supply the information for your site and your
site's administrative account in the setup wizard.}
\end{figure}

There are three sections of the wizard: the portal, the administrator
and the database. For the portal, you need to supply the following
information:

\textbf{Portal Name:} the name of the web site you're powering with
Liferay. In this book, we build a website for a lunar colony. This site
is called Lunar Resort, so we've supplied \texttt{Lunar Resort} in the
screenshot below.

\textbf{Default Language:} choose the default locale where your site
resides.

For the administrator, you need to supply the following information:

\textbf{First Name:} the first name of the user that has the
administrator account.

\textbf{Last Name:} the last name of the user that has the administrator
account.

\textbf{Email:} the email address of the user that has the administrator
account.

Liferay supports just about all the leading databases today:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  DB2
\item
  MySQL
\item
  Oracle
\item
  PostgreSQL
\item
  SQL Server
\item
  Sybase
\end{itemize}

In addition to these, Liferay also supports a few embedded databases
that are designed for development. We haven't listed these here because
you're setting up a production Life\-ray server, and you shouldn't use an
embedded database with a production box.

Before you fill out the database section of Liferay's setup wizard, you
should already have created a database for Liferay to use. If you
haven't, please see the section above entitled \emph{Liferay's
Database}.

Open the Database section of the wizard. From the select box, choose
your database. You'll see a form which lets you specify the URL to the
database, the driver class, and the user credentials (see below). Most
of this is filled out already; all you should need to do is supply the
name of your database and the server it's running on, as well as the
user credentials.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/setup-wizard-2.png}
\caption{\\Figure 18.16: Fill out the information for your database. We've
chosen MySQL in this example and have created a database called
\emph{lunar\_resort} to hold our Liferay data.}
\end{figure}

Once you've filled out the form, click \emph{Finish Configuration}.
You'll see a message stating that Liferay is being installed as it
creates the tables and data it needs in its database. When it's
finished, it tells you the location of the configuration file
(\texttt{por\-tal-set\-up-wi\-zard.pro\-per\-ties}) where it saved all your
settings. From here, you can go to your home page.

Congratulations! You've just installed Liferay Portal! The next thing
you need to do is set up your mail configuration, so Liferay can send
email notifications to users. This is covered in the Manual
Configuration section below.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} The wizard is an extremely helpful tool, especially if
you're setting up Liferay for the first time or creating a completely
fresh portal instance. If you're a Liferay veteran and you already have
your database information and various properties set up, you can skip
the wizard by adding this line to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties}
file:

\begin{verbatim}
setup.wizard.enabled=false
\end{verbatim}

\end{roundedframe}
\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip:} In Liferay 6.2, the admin user test@liferay.com is created
by the setup wizard even when a different user is specified. This means
that two admin users are created: test@liferay.com and the specified
user. Unless you're just installing Liferay for testing purposes, you
should deactivate the test@liferay.com user after your database has been
created.

\end{roundedframe}
\section{Manual Configuration}\label{manual-configuration}

You don't have to use the setup wizard to configure Liferay. The setup
wizard behind the scenes creates a configuration file that you can
create manually. Create a text file called
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} in your Liferay Home folder. This file
overrides default properties that come with Liferay. The first setting
you'll override is the default configuration that points Liferay to the
embedded HSQL database.

As stated above, there are two ways to set up the connection:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use the built-in connection pool.
\item
  Use your application server's connection pool.
\end{itemize}

Use the setup wizard if you're using the built-in connection pool. If
you want to use your application server's pool, continue with this
procedure.

If you want to use your application server's connection pool, you will
have to create one in your application server that points to your
database. The connection pool should be called
\texttt{jdbc/LiferayPool}. In the application server sections above,
there are instructions for how to do this on each application server
that Liferay supports. To tell Liferay to use your
\texttt{jdbc/LiferayPool} connection pool, add the following directive
to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
jdbc.default.jndi.name=jdbc/LiferayPool
\end{verbatim}

Next, install Liferay according to the instructions for your application
server. Once it's installed, you can set up the mail configuration.

For mail, you can use Liferay's control panel to create the
configuration and this is the recommended way. Go to \emph{Control Panel
$\rightarrow$Server Administration $\rightarrow$Mail} and enter your settings for your mail
session settings. If, however, you're setting up a lot of Liferay
machines and they're all going to have similar mail configurations, it's
easier to do the configuration once and then copy the configuration file
to multiple machines. In this case, you'll want to use the
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. To use the built-in mail session,
use the following properties and customize their values for your
environment:

\begin{verbatim}
mail.session.mail.pop3.host=localhost
mail.session.mail.pop3.password=
mail.session.mail.pop3.port=110
mail.session.mail.pop3.user=
mail.session.mail.smtp.auth=false
mail.session.mail.smtp.host=localhost
mail.session.mail.smtp.password=
mail.session.mail.smtp.port=25
mail.session.mail.smtp.user=
mail.session.mail.store.protocol=pop3
mail.session.mail.transport.protocol=smtp
\end{verbatim}

To use your application server's mail session, create it first. Then
specify it in the \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
mail.session.jndi.name=mail/MailSession
\end{verbatim}

When you've finished, save the file.

All the instructions above assumed that you wanted to install Liferay
Portal at the root context of your server. But what if that isn't the
case? Next, you'll see how to use a different context for Liferay
Portal.

\section{Making Liferay Coexist with Other Java EE
Applications}\label{making-liferay-coexist-with-other-java-ee-applications}

Liferay Portal by default is configured to sit at the root (i.e.,
\texttt{/}) of your application server. Dedicating your application
server to running only Liferay Portal is a good practice, allowing for
separation between your portal environment and your web application
environment. This is generally a best practice for portals, which by
definition are application development platforms in and of themselves.
For that reason, your instance of Liferay is likely to be hosting many
applications and even integrating several of them together on a single
page. For this reason, you should design your system so your portal
environment has all the resources it needs to do this. Configuring it so
it is the sole consumer of any other \texttt{.war} files that get
deployed to the application server helps to make sure your system
performs optimally.

If, however, you want Liferay to share space on an application server
with other applications, you can. In this instance, you may not want to
make Liferay the default application in the root context of the server.
If you want to install Liferay in a context other than the root context,
follow the instructions from your app server vendor. No additional steps
are necessary.

Now that you have Liferay installed in the context you wish, you'll want
to understand Liferay's releases and the process for keeping your
installation up to date. We'll spend a brief amount of time on that
next.

\section{Understanding Liferay's
Releases}\label{understanding-liferays-releases}

Which version of Liferay should you install? That's an easy question to
answer: if this is a new installation, we recommend you install the
latest version available. If you want to understand how Liferay releases
work, read on. Otherwise, you can skip this section for now and read it
later.

Liferay's release process follows a prescribed structure that is
consistent from one release to the next. Each release has a specific
number sequence attached to it, signifying the type of release it is:
major, minor or maintenance release. Each release also has a term
attached to it to indicate its intended level of quality.

EE subscribers have access to additional maintenance releases, along
with specific \emph{Fix Packs} and \emph{Hot Fixes} that make applying
updates to production environments safer and faster.

Let's start with an explanation of Liferay's version structure. Liferay
versions are organized in a straightforward numerical system consisting
of a three digit number. For example, 6.1.2. These numbers represent the
type of the release: Major.Minor.Maintenance.

A change in the first or second digit of the version (e.g., 6.x to 7.x
or 6.1 to 6.2) is a major or minor release. This means that there are
changes in functionality or new functionality based on high demand.
There are new features and bug fixes from prior releases. There are also
architectural changes, changes to APIs (as part of the deprecation
process), or changes to internal schema for frameworks such as Service
Builder, because new features have been added. Customizations may be
affected when installing. Customers should leverage the upgrade tools
and documentation.

A change in the third digit of the version scheme (e.g, 6.2.1 to 6.2.2)
is a maintenance release. This means that each maintenance release
provides an improved level of security and reliability. Customizations
are generally safe, but we recommend doing a review. No new features are
included.

These rules are relaxed when a minor or major release is still in beta
quality.

Now let's delve into the evolution of versions.

\subsection{Release Process}\label{release-process}

Each release of Liferay has a surname that specifies its expected
quality. This is needed because pre-releases of Liferay look very much
like maintenance releases when viewed solely through their version
numbers. The surname in general replaces the third digit in the version,
but is visible through the logs and administration UIs. Here is a
description of each surname and what it means:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Milestone} and \textbf{Beta:} (6.2 M1, 6.2 B1, 6.2 B2,
  \ldots{}) There can be zero or more of these types within each minor
  or major release. These releases are meant for testing and to provide
  Liferay feedback through the beta testing category in the forums.
  There will likely be major changes in milestone releases, but beta
  releases are considered ``feature complete'' and should have only bug
  fixes.
\item
  \textbf{Release Candidates:} (6.2 RC1, 6.2 RC2) There can be zero,
  one, or more of these right after the beta releases. These releases
  appear near the end of the release process and are candidates for
  release. As such, they should have minimal to no bugs, but because
  they are very new, some minor bugs may have slipped by.
\item
  \textbf{General Availability:} (6.2 GA1, 6.2 GA2, \ldots{}.) There can
  be one or more of these releases. A General Availability release is a
  re-label of the last release candidate, based on internal testing and
  feedback from beta testers. These releases are stable and are made
  available via Liferay's Downloads page for CE and on the Customer
  Portal for EE.
\end{itemize}

Armed with this information, here's our advice for how to manage your
Liferay installation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When starting a new project, always use the latest stable version
  available; that is, the latest available GA. At the time of writing,
  the most recent version is Liferay CE 6.2 GA1 (6.2.0) or Liferay EE
  6.1 GA2 (6.2.00).
\item
  Always update to the latest maintenance release available for the
  functional version (major or minor) that you are using. For example,
  if you started your project with Liferay 6.2.0 GA1, it is recommended
  that you switch to GA2 if/when it becomes available to take advantage
  of bug fixes and improvements. If you have a subscription, you can
  benefit from the fixes faster by requesting fix packs and hot fixes
  from the support team.
\item
  You are always welcome to use any preview, beta or release candidate.
  In fact, that's why they exist--so as many people as possible start
  using it and provide us their feedback. Please note, we do not
  recommend using pre-releases (milestones, betas, or release
  candidates) in production. You may not want to use these releases even
  during development if you have tight deadlines, since you may hit some
  unexpected bugs.
\item
  Plugins that work in any GA or fix pack version will work in any later
  maintenance release. That is, a plugin developed for Liferay 6.2 GA1
  will also work in Liferay 6.2 GA2 or a GA2 fix pack.
\end{itemize}

For more details on updating Liferay Portal, see Upgrading Liferay in
chapter 19.

Liferay Portal is a very flexible application that runs well on several
different server environments. It's simple to install and follows a
systematic versioning system that makes it easy to keep current with the
latest updates. The strength of the Liferay community helps detect
potential issues early that are then reported through the forums and are
later fixed in a series of maintenance releases.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-18}

This chapter is a guide to everything about installing Liferay. Whether
you choose a Liferay bundle or an existing application server, Liferay
Portal integrates seamlessly with your enterprise Java environment. It
is supported on more application servers than any other portal platform,
allowing you to preserve your investment in your application server of
choice or giving you the freedom to move to a different application
server platform. Liferay is committed to providing you this freedom: we
have 500 test servers certifying our builds with roughly 10,000 tests
per version of Liferay Portal. Each of those tests are run on all of our
different supported combinations of application servers, databases and
operating systems. Because of this, you can be sure we are committed to
supporting you on your environment of choice. You can feel safe knowing
you have the freedom to use the software platform that is best for your
organization and that Liferay Portal runs and performs well on it.

\chapter{Advanced Portal Operation}\label{advanced-portal-operation}

In this chapter, you'll find several advanced features of Liferay
Portal, including portal maintenance, backup, and logging. You'll also
learn how to access Liferay's web services remotely. It's generally not
much more complicated to maintain a running Liferay instance than it is
to maintain the application server upon which it's running. However,
Liferay provides tools for logging, patching, and upgrading Liferay that
you should know how to use. It's also important to follow secure backup
procedures to protect your Liferay instance's source code, database, and
properties files.

We'll discuss the following topics in this section:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Backing Up a Liferay Installation
\item
  Changing Logging Levels
\item
  Patching Liferay

  Upgrading Liferay
\item
  Sandboxing Portlets to Ensure Portal Resiliency
\item
  Using Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP)
\item
  Remotely Accessing Liferay Services
\end{itemize}

First, you'll learn how to back up a Liferay installation.

\section{Backing up a Liferay
Installation}\label{backing-up-a-liferay-installation}

Once you have an installation of Liferay Portal running, you'll want to
have proper backup procedures in place in case of a catastrophic
hardware failure of some kind. Liferay isn't very different from any
other application that may be running on your application server.
Nevertheless, there are some specific components you should include in
your backup plan.

\subsection{Backing up Source Code}\label{backing-up-source-code}

If you have extended Liferay or have written any plugins, they should be
stored in a source code repository such as Git, Subversion, or CVS,
unless you're Linus Torvalds, and then tarballs are okay too (that's a
joke). Your source code repository should be backed up on a regular
basis to preserve your ongoing work. This probably goes without saying
in your organization, as nobody wants to lose source code that's taken
months to produce, but we thought we should mention it anyway.

If you're extending Liferay with an Ext plugin, you'll want to make sure
you also store the version of the Liferay source on which your extension
environment is based. This allows your developers convenient access to
all the tools they need to build your extension and deploy it to a
server.

Let's look at the items that need to be backed up in your Liferay
installation.

\subsection{Backing up Liferay's File
System}\label{backing-up-liferays-file-system}

Liferay's configuration file, \texttt{portal-ext.properties}, gets stored in
the \emph{Liferay Home} folder, which is generally one folder up from where
your application server is installed (see the \emph{Installation and Setup}
chapter of this guide for specific details for your application server). At a
minimum, this file should be backed up, but it is generally best to back up
your whole application server.

If you've followed the non-plugin procedure (see chapter 19) to modify
your Ehcache configuration, you'll have cache configuration files in the
deploy location of Liferay. You'll need to back up this location. If
you're using the plugin procedure (i.e., the recommended procedure),
your cache configuration settings are stored in your source code
repository, which is backed up separately.

Liferay stores configuration files, search indexes, and cache
information in a folder called \texttt{/data} in Liferay Home. If you're
using the File System store or the Advanced File System store, the media
repository is stored here (by default) too. You should always back up
the contents of your Liferay Home folder.

If you've modified the location where the Document Library stores files,
you should also back up this location.

That covers the file system locations Liferay uses. Next, let's discuss
how to back up Liferay's database.

\subsection{Backing up Liferay's
Database}\label{backing-up-liferays-database}

Liferay's database is the central repository for all of the Portal's
information and is the most important component that needs to be backed
up. You can do this by backing up the database live (if your database
allows this) or by exporting the database and then backing up the
exported file. For example, MySQL ships with a \texttt{mysqldump}
utility which allows you to export the entire database and data into a
large SQL file. This file can then be backed up. In case of a database
failure, this file can be used to recreate the state of the database at
the time the dump was created.

If you're using Liferay's Documents and Media Library with the
Jackrabbit JSR-170 repository to store documents in a database, the
Jackrabbit database should be backed up also. If you've placed your
search index into a database (not recommended; see chapter 19 for
information on using Cluster Link or Solr), that database should be
backed up as well.

Search indexes can be backed up as well, if you wish to avoid reindexing
your entire portal after you do your restore. This is easiest to do if
you have a separate Solr environment upon which your index is stored. If
you're in a clustered configuration and you're replicating indexes,
you'll need to back up each index replica.

Restoring your application server, your Liferay Home folder, the
locations of any file system-based media repositories, and your database
from a backup system should give you a functioning portal. Restoring
search indexes should avoid the need to reindex when you bring your site
back up after a catastrophic failure. Good, consistent backup procedures
are key to successfully recovering from a hardware failure.

But what about maintenance while your server is running? Liferay lets
you view a lot of what is going on through its logging system.

\section{Liferay's Logging System}\label{liferays-logging-system}

Liferay's logging system uses Log4j extensively to implement logging for
nearly every class in the portal. If you need to debug something
specific while the system is running, you can use the control panel to
set logging levels by class dynamically.

To view the log levels, go to the control panel, click \emph{Server
Administration} in the Server section, and then click the \emph{Log
Levels} tab.

A paginated list of logging categories appears. These categories
correspond to Liferay classes that have log messages in them. By
default, all categories are set to display messages only if there is an
error that occurs in the class. This is why you see ERROR displayed in
all of the drop-down list boxes on the right side of the portlet.

Each category is filtered by its place in the class hierarchy. For
example, if you wanted to see logging for a specific class that is
registered in Liferay, you would browse to that specific class and
change its log level to something that is more descriptive, such as
DEBUG. Once you click the \emph{Save} button at the bottom of the list,
you'll start seeing DEBUG messages from that class in your application
server's log file.

If you're not sure which class you want to see log messages for, you can
find a place higher up in the hierarchy and select the package name
instead of an individual class name. If you do this, messages for every
class lower in the hierarchy will be displayed in your application
server's log file.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/maintaining-log-levels.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.1: Log levels can be dynamically changed at runtime
whenever you need to debug an issue.}
\end{figure}

Be careful when you do this. If you set the log level to DEBUG somewhere
near the top of the hierarchy (such as \texttt{com.liferay}, for
example), you may wind up with a lot of messages in your log file. This
could make it difficult to find the one you were looking for, and causes
the server to do more work writing messages to the log.

If you want to set the log level for one of your own classes in a
deployed plugin, you can register that class with Liferay to control the
log levels more easily, so long as your class uses Liferay's logging
system to do its logging.

You will first need to import interfaces and implement logging in your
class, with statements such as these (taken from Liferay's
\texttt{S3Store} class):

\begin{verbatim}
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.log.Log;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.log.LogFactoryUtil;
     ...

private static Log _log = LogFactory.getLog(S3Store.class);
\end{verbatim}

You would then use this \texttt{\_log} variable to create log messages
in your code for the various logging levels:

\begin{verbatim}
_log.error(s3se.getMessage());
\end{verbatim}

To enable your logging messages to appear in your server's log file via
the control panel, click the \emph{Add Category} tab on the same
\emph{Log Levels} page.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/maintaining-add-log-category.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.2: Adding your own logging classes is easy. To add a
logging class, just specify it in this field.}
\end{figure}

You'll see you can add a logging category. Put in the fully qualified
name of your class or of the package that contains the classes whose log
messages you want to view, choose a log level, then click the
\emph{Save} button. You will now start to see log messages from your own
class or classes in the server's log file.

Logs are great for figuring out issues in production. But what if
Liferay contacts you via its support channel with a bug fix or a
security enhancement? Read on to learn how to patch Liferay.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note}: Logging changes within the control panel don't persist
across restarts. If you want to make your changes persistent, you can
create a \texttt{META-INF/portal-log4j-ext.xml} file and deploy it,
using the \texttt{portal-log4j.xml} file from Liferay's source as a
guide.

\section{Patching Liferay}\label{patching-liferay}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.25\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/ee-feature-web.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

While we strive for perfection with every release of Liferay Portal, the
reality of the human condition dictates that releases of the product may
not be as perfect as originally intended. But we've planned for that.
Included with every Liferay bundle is a patching tool that can handle
the installation of two types of patches: hot fixes and fix packs.

A hot fix is provided to a customer when a customer contacts Liferay
about an issue, and Liferay's support team--working with the
customer--determines that the problem is indeed an issue with the
product that needs to be fixed. Support fixes the bug and provides a hot
fix to the customer immediately. This is a short-term fix that solves
the issue for the customer as quickly as possible.

On a regular schedule, these hot fixes are bundled together into fix
packs. Fix packs are provided to all of Liferay's customers and are
component-based. This means any issues with the content management
system will be bundled together separately from issues with another
component, such as the message boards. This lets you determine which
patches are critical and which are not, based on your usage. Of course,
if Liferay issues a security advisory, that's something you're always
going to want to patch.

Now that you know what patching is all about, let's check out the tool.

\subsection{Installing the patching
tool}\label{installing-the-patching-tool}

If you're using a Liferay bundle, congratulations! The patching tool is
already installed. Your job isn't done yet, however, because Liferay
\emph{might} have updated the patching tool. Always check the Customer
Portal to see if the patching tool has been updated first. But even if
you forget to check, the patching tool will tell you if it needs to be
updated when you run it. A lot of planning and forethought has gone into
the patching system to make it run as smoothly as possible.

You follow the same procedure whether you're installing or upgrading the
patching tool. Once you've obtained it from the customer portal, unzip
it to the Liferay Home folder. This is the folder where you've placed
your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file and where by default the
\texttt{data} folder resides. This is generally one folder up from where
your application server is installed, but some application servers are
different. If you don't know where Liferay Home is on your system, check
chapter 14 to see where this folder is for your specific application
server.

If you're upgrading the patching tool, all you need to do is unzip the
new version on top of the old version. Note that if you're doing this on
LUM (Linux, Unix, Mac) machines, you'll need to make the
\texttt{patching-tool.sh} script executable.

After the patching tool is installed, you need to let it auto-discover
your Liferay installation. Then it will determine what your release
level is and what your application server environment is. This is a
simple command to run on LUM:

\begin{verbatim}
./patching-tool.sh auto-discovery
\end{verbatim}

or on Windows:

\begin{verbatim}
patching-tool auto-discovery
\end{verbatim}

From here on, for brevity we'll use the LUM version of the command. Why?
Because Liferay is open source; there's no open source variant of
Windows (ReactOS is still in alpha, so it doesn't count); and therefore
my (RS) unscientific impression is that more people will run Liferay on
open source technology than not. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but there are
still many other examples of documentation that defaults to Windows, so
we still get to be different.

If you've installed the patching tool in a non-standard location, you'll
have to give this command another parameter to point it to your Liferay
installation. For example, if you've installed a Liferay/Tomcat bundle
in \texttt{/opt/Liferay}, you'd issue this command:

\begin{verbatim}
./patching-tool.sh auto-discovery /opt/Liferay/tomcat-7.0.21
\end{verbatim}

In all, this is pretty simple. Now let's see how to use the patching
tool to get your patches installed.

\subsection{Installing patches}\label{installing-patches}

The absolute first thing you must do when installing one or more patches
is to shut down your server. On Windows operating systems, files that
are in use are locked by the OS, and won't be patched. On LUM systems,
you can generally replace files that are running, but of course that
still leaves the old ones loaded in memory. So your best bet is to shut
down the application server that's running Liferay before you install a
patch.

Liferay distributes patches as \texttt{.zip} files, whether they are hot
fixes or fix packs. When you receive one, either via a LESA ticket (hot
fix) or through downloading a fix pack from the customer portal, you'll
need to place it in the \texttt{patches} folder, which is inside the
patching tool's home folder. Once you've done that, it's a simple matter
to install it. First, execute

\begin{verbatim}
./patching-tool.sh info
\end{verbatim}

This shows you a list of patches you've already installed, along with a
list of patches that \emph{can} be installed, from what's in the
\texttt{patches} folder. To install the available patches, issue the
following command:

\begin{verbatim}
./patching-tool.sh install
\end{verbatim}

Liferay copies files into the plugins in deployment time. If these files
are patched in the portal, they need to be updated in the plugins as
well. In these cases, the patching tool notifies you about the change.
You can run the following command to update these files automatically:

\begin{verbatim}
./patching-tool.sh update-plugins
\end{verbatim}

If you do not wish to have the patching tool update the plugins, it's
enough to re-deploy them. If there are new indexes created by the patch,
the patching tool notifies you to update them. To get the list, run this
command:

\begin{verbatim}
./patching-tool.sh index-info
\end{verbatim}

As there's no database connection at patching time, the patches needed
to be created at portal startup. In order to get the indexes
automatically created, add the following line to the
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file if the server has permissions to
modify the indexes on the database:

\begin{verbatim}
database.indexes.update.on.startup=true
\end{verbatim}

Otherwise, you have to create the indexes manually. Check the output of
the \texttt{./patch\-ing-tool in\-dex-in\-fo} command for more details.

Once your patches have been installed, you can verify them by using the
\texttt{./patch\-ing-tool.sh in\-fo} command, which now shows your patch in
the list of installed patch\-es. Next, you'll look at how to manage
your patches.

\subsubsection{Handling hot fixes and
patches}\label{handling-hot-fixes-and-patches}

As stated above, hot fixes are short term fixes provided as quickly as
possible and fix packs are larger bundles of hot fixes provided to all
customers at regular intervals. If you already have a hot fix installed,
and the fix pack which contains that hot fix is released, you can rest
assured the patching tool will manage this for you. Fix packs always
supersede hot fixes, so when you install your fix pack, the hot fix that
it already contains is uninstalled, and the fix pack version is
installed in its place.

Sometimes there can be a fix to a fix pack. This is also handled
automatically. If a new version of a fix pack is released, you can use
the patching tool to install it. The patching tool uninstalls the old
fix pack and installs the new version in its place.

\subsubsection{Fix pack dependencies}\label{fix-pack-dependencies}

Some fix packs require other fix packs to be installed first. If you
attempt to install a fix pack that depends on another fix pack, the
patching tool will notify you of this so you can go to the customer
portal and obtain the fix pack dependency. Once all the necessary fix
packs are available in the \texttt{patches} folder, the patching tool
will install them.

The patching tool can also remove patches.

\subsection{Removing or reverting
patches}\label{removing-or-reverting-patches}

Have you noticed that the patching tool only seems to have an
\texttt{install} command? This is because patches are managed not by the
command, but by what appears in the \texttt{patches} folder. You manage
the patches you have installed by adding or removing patches from this
folder. If you currently have a patch installed and you don't want it
installed, remove it from the \texttt{patches} folder. Then run the
\texttt{./patching-tool.sh install} command, and the patch is removed.

If you want to remove all patches you've installed, use the following command: 

\begin{verbatim}
./patching-tool.sh revert
\end{verbatim}
 
 This removes all patches from your installation.

What we've described so far is the simplest way to use the patching
tool, but you can also use the patching tool in the most complex,
multi-VM, clustered environments. This is done by using profiles.

\subsection{Using profiles with the patching
tool}\label{using-profiles-with-the-patching-tool}

When you ran the auto-discovery task after installing the patching tool,
it created a default profile that points to the application server it
discovered. This is the easiest way to use the patching tool, and is
great for smaller, single server installations. But we realize many
Liferay installations are sized accordingly to serve millions of pages
per day, and the patching tool has been designed for this as well. So if
you're running a small, medium, or large cluster of Liferay machines,
you can use the patching tool to manage all of them using profiles.

The auto-discovery task creates a properties file called
\texttt{default.properties}. This file contains the detected
configuration for your application server. But you're not limited to
only one server which the tool can detect. You can have it auto-discover
other runtimes, or you can manually create new profiles yourself.

To have the patching tool auto-discover other runtimes, you'll need to
use a few more command line parameters:

\begin{verbatim}
./patching-tool.sh [name of profile] auto-discovery [path/to/runtime]
\end{verbatim}

This will run the same discovery process, but on a path you choose, and
the profile information will go into a
\texttt{{[}your profile name{]}.properties} file.

Alternatively, you can manually create your profiles. Using a text
editor, create a \texttt{{[}pro\-file name{]}.pro\-per\-ties} file in the same
folder as the patching tool script. You can place the following
properties in the file:

\textbf{patching.mode:} This can be \texttt{binary} (the default) or
\texttt{source}, if you're patching the source tree you're working with.
Liferay patches contain both binary and source patches. If your
development team is extending Liferay, you'll want to provide the
patches you install to your development team so they can patch their
source tree.

\textbf{patches.folder:} Specify the location where you'll copy your
patches. By default, this is \texttt{./patches}.

\textbf{war.path:} No, no one's angry. This is a property for which you
specify the location of the Liferay installation inside your application
server. Alternatively, you can specify a .war file here, and you'll be
able to patch a Liferay .war for installation to your application
server.

\textbf{global.lib.path:} Specify the location where .jar files on the
global classpath are stored. If you're not sure, search for your
\texttt{portal-service.jar} file; it's on the global classpath. This
property is only valid if your \texttt{patching.mode} is
\texttt{binary}.

\textbf{source.path:} Specify the location of your Liferay source tree.
This property is only valid if your \texttt{patching.mode} is
\texttt{source}.

You can have as many profiles as you want, and use the same patching
tool to patch all of them. This helps to keep all your installations in
sync.

Now that you know how to patch an existing installation of Liferay,
let's turn to how you'd upgrade Liferay from an older release to the
current release.

\section{Upgrading Liferay}\label{upgrading-liferay}

Liferay upgrades are fairly straightforward. A consistent set of steps
is all you need to follow to upgrade a standard Liferay installation.
Things do get more complicated if your organization has used Ext plugins
to customize Liferay. It's possible that API changes in the new version
will break your existing code. This, however, is usually pretty easy for
your developers to fix. Portlet plugins which use Liferay APIs should be
reviewed and their services rebuilt against the new release. Theme
plugins may require some modifications to take advantage of new
features, and if they're using Liferay APIs, they should be reviewed.
Much effort has been made to make upgrades as painless as possible;
however, this is not a guarantee everything will work without
modification. Ext plugins are the most complicating factor in an
upgrade, so it is important to test as much as possible.

Prior to Liferay 6.1 SP2, you could upgrade only from one major release
to the next major release. For example, you could upgrade directly from
Liferay 5.2.x to 6.0.x, but not from 5.1.x to 6.0.x. If you needed to
upgrade over several major releases, you needed to run the upgrade
procedure for each major release until you reached the release you want.
This doesn't mean you needed to run the procedure for every point
release or service pack; you only needed to run the procedure for the
major releases. A good practice was to use the latest version of each
major release to upgrade your system.

Liferay introduced the \emph{seamless upgrade} feature with Liferay 6.1.
Seamless upgrades allow Liferay to be upgraded more easily. In most
cases, pointing the latest version of Liferay to the database of the
older version is enough. Of course, before upgrading, you should test
the upgrade in a non-production environment. You should also always back
up your database and other important information and make all the other
appropriate preparations that we'll discuss in the section.

Now that we've discussed the general philosophy of upgrading, let's
outline the procedure for upgrading to Liferay 6.2.

\subsection{Preparing for an Upgrade}\label{preparing-for-an-upgrade}

Before you begin upgrading Liferay to a new version, consider your
current Liferay installation. If you're running Liferay EE, is it
patched to the most recent Service Pack level? If not, refer to the
section on Patching Liferay before you upgrade; the upgrade process is
designed to occur on a fully patched Liferay. If you're running Liferay
CE, make sure you have the latest GA release.

Now that Liferay is updated to the latest release of its current
version, the first upgrade task is to size up your situation. Do this by
asking yourself a few questions from the chart below. First: What
version of Liferay was the first version you installed? If it was 6.0 or
6.1, there are fewer steps, because you won't have to worry about
migrating your permission algorithm. If, however, you never upgraded to
permissions algorithm 6 or you're still running a 5.x Liferay, you need
to migrate to algorithm 6 before attempting to upgrade to Liferay 6.2.

Next, if you're upgrading from a version of Liferay older than 6.1,
you'll have to migrate your image gallery over to Documents and Media.
Finally, take note of all the plugins you have installed. Every plugin
must be updated to run on the current release. This is easy to do with
Marketplace: after you bring up Liferay 6.2, install from Marketplace
any of the plugins you had installed previously. For custom plugins,
have your development team update them to run on the new version of
Liferay.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/upgrade-decisions.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.3: Use this flowchart to determine the steps to take
for your upgrade.}
\end{figure}

The flowchart illustrates the procedure described above. Use it to
determine your course of action for the upgrade. Each step is described
fully below so that you can perform your upgrade as efficiently as
possible. Be sure to test the upgrade in a non-production environment
before upgrading your production Liferay instance.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note}: In Liferay 6.2, the Global repository that was used to
store Web Content and Documents and Media is now its own site with the
reserved friendly URL \texttt{/global}; upgrading to Liferay 6.2 will
fail if any sites are using the same URL. Before upgrading to Liferay
6.2, make sure no current friendly URL violates the restriction.

\end{roundedframe}
Let's look at the preparatory tasks you should perform one by one.

\subsection{Migrate to Algorithm 6}\label{migrate-to-algorithm-6}

If your Liferay installation has existed for a while, you might be on a
different permission algorithm than the one that's available in Liferay
Portal 6.1. Permission algorithms 1-5 were deprecated in Liferay Portal
6.0 and were removed in 6.1, which means you must migrate \emph{before}
you upgrade.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Important}: Before upgrading a Liferay instance that's using one
of permissions algorithms 1-5, you \emph{must} migrate to permissions
algorithm 6 before attempting to upgrade to Liferay 6.2. You can't use
the seamless upgrade feature to upgrade directly to 6.2 because
Liferay's permissions migration tool is not included with Liferay 6.2.
Follow the instructions in this section to migrate to permissions
algorithm 6 before continuing with your upgrade.

\end{roundedframe}
If you're on Liferay 5.2 or below, you must upgrade to the latest
available release of Liferay 6.0 first. Please follow the instructions
in the
\href{https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.0/administration/-/ai/upgrading-lifer-4}{\emph{Liferay
Portal Administrator's Guide}} to do this. We will assume for the rest
of this section that you have upgraded to Liferay 6.0 but that's it's
configured to use an older algorithm than algorithm 6.

The first thing you need to do, if this is not done already, is to
upgrade your Liferay installation to algorithm 5. If you've already done
that, great! You can skip the rest of this paragraph. If not, shut down
your server, edit your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file, and
modify/add the following property so that it reads like this:

\begin{verbatim}
permissions.user.check.algorithm=5
\end{verbatim}

Restart your server. As Liferay starts, it upgrades your permissions
algorithm to algorithm 5. Review your system to make sure that your
permissions configuration is working properly (it should be).

Next, log in as an administrator and navigate to the Control Panel. Go
to \emph{Server Administration} and select \emph{Data Migration} from
the menu along the top of the screen. A section entitled \emph{Legacy
Permissions Migration} appears at the bottom of the page.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/17-convert-permissions-algorithm.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.4: Update your permissions algorithm by clicking the
\emph{Execute} button.}
\end{figure}

Algorithms 5 and 6 do not support adding permissions at the user level.
If you have permissions set for individual users, the converter can
simulate this for you. To do this, it auto-generates roles for each
individual permission, and then assigns those roles to the users who
have individualized permissions. If you have a lot of these, you'll
likely want to go through and clean them up after the conversion
process. To generate these roles, check the \emph{Generate Custom Roles}
box. If you do not generate the roles, all custom permissions set for
individual users are discarded.

Click \emph{Execute} to convert all existing users and roles to
algorithm 6. When the process completes, shut down your server. Edit
your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file and modify the algorithm
property to show that you're now using algorithm 6:

\begin{verbatim}
permissions.user.check.algorithm=6
\end{verbatim}

Restart your server. Congratulations! You've successfully migrated your
installation to use the latest, highest performing permissions
algorithm. Next, might need to explicitly set your Image Gallery storage
option.

\subsection{Migrate Your Image Gallery
Images}\label{migrate-your-image-gallery-images}

Liferay 6.1 introduced a major change to how Liferay handles files.
Liferay 6.0 and previous versions had a separate Document Library and
Image Gallery. In Liferay 6.1 and 6.2, these are combined into the
Documents and Media repository. If you were using Liferay's Image
Gallery to store images, these can be migrated over during an upgrade,
but you'll have to take some extra steps first.

In Liferay 6.0, you had three ways you could store images in the Image
Gallery. You could use the \texttt{DatabaseHook} and store them as BLOBs
in the database; you could use the \texttt{DLHook} to store them in the
Document Library, or you could use the \texttt{FileSystemHook} to store
them in a folder on your server's file system. Before you upgrade,
you'll need to set whichever property you were using in your 6.0
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file, because by default, none of them
are enabled in 6.1. Setting one of the properties triggers the migration
during the upgrade process. Below are the three properties; you'll need
to set only \emph{one} of them (the one you were using).

\begin{verbatim}
image.hook.impl=com.liferay.portal.image.DatabaseHook
image.hook.impl=com.liferay.portal.image.DLHook
image.hook.impl=com.liferay.portal.image.FileSystemHook
\end{verbatim}

By default, Liferay 6.0 used the \texttt{FileSystemHook}. If you never
customized this property for your installation, you'd use the
\texttt{FileSystemHook} property above. If you customized the property,
you should know which one you used, and it is likely already in your
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file.

The third thing you need to do to prepare for your upgrade is to review
the new property defaults.

\subsection{Review the Liferay 6.2 Properties
Defaults}\label{review-the-liferay-6.2-properties-defaults}

The next thing you'll need to look at are the defaults that have changed
between your old Liferay instance's version and Liferay 6.2. These are
preserved in a \texttt{por\-tal-le\-ga\-cy-{[}ver\-sion{]}.pro\-per\-ties} file in
Liferay's \texttt{/WEB-INF/classes} folder and in the
\texttt{por\-tal-im\-pl/src} folder of Liferay's source code. For example,
here are some 6.1 legacy properties:

\begin{verbatim}
hibernate.cache.use_query_cache=true
hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache=true
locale.prepend.friendly.url.style=1
passwords.encryption.algorithm.legacy=SHA
mobile.device.styling.wap.enabled=true
journal.articles.search.with.index=false
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{passwords.encryption.algorithm.legacy} and
\texttt{mo\-bile.de\-vice.styl\-ing\-.wap.\-en\-a\-bled} properties do not exist in
6.1. In 6.2, the default values of some properties have changed and some new
properties have been added:

\begin{verbatim}
hibernate.cache.use_query_cache=false
hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache=false
locale.prepend.friendly.url.style=3
passwords.encryption.algorithm.legacy=
mobile.device.styling.wap.enabled=false
journal.articles.search.with.index=true
\end{verbatim}

Please refer to the 6.1 and 6.2 versions of Liferay's
\texttt{portal.properties} file for explanations of each of these
properties. This file can be found in the your Liferay instance's
\texttt{/WEB-INF/lib/portal-impl.jar} file. Online versions can also be
found at
\url{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.1/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html}
and
\url{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html}.
Please also note the following changes in behavior:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  By default, Liferay 6.1 used the DES encryption algorithm with a 56
  bit key size for the company level encryption algorithm.
  company.encryption.algorithm=DES company.encryption.key.size=56 By
  default, Liferay 6.2 uses the much stronger AES encryption algorithm
  with a 128 bit key size for the company level encryption algorithm.
  AES-128 is believed to be secure, is fast, and is a standard for
  symmetric key encryption. company.encryption.algorithm=AES
  company.encryption.key.size=128 However, the upgrade for the
  \texttt{company.encryption.algorithm} property is only performed if
  the value for this properties was not customized, i.e., if it was
  still set to DES. The upgrade doesn't make any changes if a different
  algorithm was explicitly selected. (Note that this does not affect
  password encryption which a different property handles:
  \texttt{passwords.encryption.algorithm}.)
\item
  By default, Liferay 6.1 used the SHA algorithm for password
  encryption.

\begin{verbatim}
passwords.encryption.algorithm=SHA
\end{verbatim}

  By default, Liferay 6.2 uses a stronger algorithm,
  PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1/160/128000, for password encryption. PBKDF2
  (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is a key derivation
  function that's part of RSA's PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography Standards)
  series: PKCS \#5, version 2.0. It's also described in the IETF's
  \href{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898}{RFC 2898}. The
  \texttt{PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1/160/128000} algorithm uses a keyed-hash
  message authentication code using SHA-1 and generates 160-bit hashes
  using 128,000 rounds. One round is a single iteration of the key
  derivation function.

  \begin{verbatim}
  passwords.encryption.algorithm=PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1/160/128000
  \end{verbatim}

  Performance is affected by password encryption during sign-in and
  password chan\-ges. In 2012, \href{http://www.owasp.org}{OWASP}, the
  Open Web Application Security Project, recommended to use 64,000
  rounds and to double the number of rounds each year. If using PBKDF2
  with 128,000 rounds is too expensive for the hardware where you're
  running Liferay, you can downgrade your security algorithm to improve
  performance by choosing a smaller number. For example, you set the
  following property:

\begin{verbatim}
passwords.encryption.algorithm=PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1/160/64000
\end{verbatim}

  If you'd like your upgrade to migrate your password encryption
  algorithm, you need to specify the legacy password encryption
  algorithm from which you're migrating. For example, if you were using
  the 6.1 default before your upgrade, you'd set the following property:

\begin{verbatim}
passwords.encryption.algorithm.legacy=SHA
\end{verbatim}

  Set this property before performing an upgrade so that both existing
  users' and new users' passwords are re-encrypted with the new
  algorithm.
\item
  After upgrading from Liferay 6.1 to Liferay 6.2, users must sign back
  in to the portal even if they were using the \emph{Remember Me}
  feature of the Sign In portlet. After the upgrade, the \emph{Remember
  Me} feature works correctly: users can log in to the portal, close
  their browser, open a new browser window, navigate to the portal, and
  still be logged in.
\end{enumerate}

If you don't like the 6.2 default properties, you can change them back
in one shot by adding a system property to your JVM's startup. This
differs by application servers. In Tomcat, you'd modify
\texttt{setenv.sh}/\texttt{setenv.bat} and append the option
\texttt{-Dex\-ter\-nal-pro\-per\-ties=por\-tal-le\-ga\-cy-{[}ver\-sion{]}.pro\-per\-ties} to
the environment variable \texttt{JA\-VA\_OPTS}. The scripts \texttt{setenv.sh} or
\texttt{setenv.bat} are not delivered with default Tomcat, but do exist
in the bundles. If they're there, Tomcat uses them in the startup
process, so it's a nice way to separate your own settings from Tomcat's
default shell scripts. Alternatively, of course, you can override some
or all of them in your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} along with your
other overrides.

If you're not using Tomcat, check your application server's
documentation to see how to modify runtime properties. Your final task
is to catalog all the plugins you have installed, so you can install the
new versions in your upgraded system.

\subsection{Catalog All Installed
Plugins}\label{catalog-all-installed-plugins}

Finally, you need to take note of any plugins you have installed.
Liferay's plugins are usually version-specific, so you'll need to obtain
new versions of them for the new release of Liferay. If you have custom
plugins created by your development team, they'll need to build, test,
and optionally modify them to work with the new release of Liferay.
Don't attempt an upgrade without collecting all the plugins you'll need
first.

For Liferay 6.2, the Web Content List portlet is deprecated. During the
deprecation period, the code will still be part of the product, but will
be disabled by default. To enable Web Content List, you'll need to
modify the \texttt{liferay-portlet.xml} file by setting the
\texttt{\textless{}include\textgreater{}false\textless{}/include\textgreater{}}
tag to \texttt{true}. However, all the functionality of this portlet is
provided by the Asset Publisher portlet. The Web Content List portlet is
expected to be removed in the next release.

Once you've upgraded your permissions algorithm, reviewed your
properties, and collected all the plugins you'll need, you're ready to
follow the upgrade procedure. Remember to back up your system before you
begin.

\subsection{Upgrade Choices: Upgrade a Bundle or Upgrade
Manually}\label{upgrade-choices-upgrade-a-bundle-or-upgrade-manually}

There are two different procedures to upgrade Liferay. The first one,
upgrading a Liferay bundle, is the most common. The second procedure is
for manually upgrading a Liferay installation on an application server.
We'll discuss both.

In both cases, Liferay auto-detects whether the database requires an
upgrade the first time the new version is started. When Liferay does
this, it upgrades the database to the format required by the new
version. To perform this task, Liferay \emph{must} be accessing the
database with a database user account that can create, drop and modify
tables. Make sure you have granted these permissions to the database
user account before you attempt to upgrade Liferay. And, of course,
we'll run the risk of overly repeating ourselves: back up your database.

Let's look at upgrading a bundle, which is the easiest upgrade path.

\subsubsection{Upgrading a Bundle}\label{upgrading-a-bundle}

If you're running a Liferay bundle, the best way to do the upgrade is to
follow the steps below. The new Liferay is installed in a newer version
of your bundle runtime. For example, the Liferay bundle for 6.1 uses a
different version of Tomcat than the Liferay bundle for 6.2. We
generally recommend you use the latest version of your runtime bundle,
as it will be supported the longest.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Obtain the new bundle. Unzip the bundle to an appropriate location on
  your system.
\item
  Copy your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file and your \texttt{data}
  folder to the new bundle.
\item
  Review your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file as described above.
  Make sure you're using permissions algorithm 6. If you were using the
  Image Gallery, make the necessary modifications so your files are
  migrated to Documents and Media. Review the new defaults and decide
  whether you want to use them. Review any other modifications you've
  made.
\item
  Start your application server. Watch the console as Liferay starts: it
  upgrades the database automatically.
\item
  When the upgrade completes, install any plugins you were using in your
  old version of Liferay. Make sure you use the versions of those
  plugins that are designed for Liferay 6.2. If you have your own
  plugins, your development team will need to migrate the code in these
  ahead of time and provide .war files for you.
\item
  Browse around in your new installation and verify everything is
  working. Have your QA team test everything. If all looks good, you can
  delete the old application server with the old release of Liferay in
  it from the bundle directory. You have a backup of it anyway, right?
  As you can see, upgrading a bundle is generally pretty simple. But not
  everybody can use bundles: sometimes, specific application servers or
  application server versions are mandated by the environment you're in
  or by management. For this reason, Liferay also ships as an
  installable .war file that can be used on any supported application
  server.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Upgrading Manually}\label{upgrading-manually}

Running a manual upgrade is almost as easy as upgrading a bundle:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Verify your application server is supported by Liferay. You can do
  this by viewing the appropriate document on the Customer Portal (EE),
  in chapter 14 (because there are installation instructions for it), or
  on liferay.com (CE). If your application server isn't supported by
  Liferay 6.2, \emph{do not continue!} You'll need to upgrade or switch
  to a supported application server first.
\item
  Obtain the Liferay Portal .war file and the dependency .jars archive.
\item
  Copy your customized \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file to a safe
  place and review it as described above, making all the appropriate
  changes.
\item
  Undeploy the old version of Liferay and shut down your application
  server.
\item
  Copy the new versions of Liferay's dependency .jars to a location on
  your server's class path, overwriting the ones you already have for
  the old version of Liferay. This location is documented for your
  application server in chapter 14.
\item
  Deploy the new Liferay .war file to your application server. Follow
  the deployment instructions in chapter 14.
\item
  Start (or, if your app server has a console from which you've
  installed the .war, restart) your application server. Watch the
  console as Liferay starts: it should upgrade the database
  automatically. Verify your portal is operating normally, and then
  install any plugins you were using in your old version of Liferay.
  Make sure you use the versions of those plugins designed for Liferay
  6.2. If you have your own plugins, your development team will need to
  migrate the code in these ahead of time and provide .war files to you.
\item
  Browse around in your new installation and verify everything is
  working. Have your QA team test everything. If all looks good, you're
  finished.
\end{enumerate}

That's all there is to it. Most everything is handled by Liferay's
upgrade procedure. Note as stated above, if you have to upgrade over
several Liferay versions, you will need to repeat these steps for each
major release.

\subsection{Post-Upgrade Tasks}\label{post-upgrade-tasks}

After upgrading to Liferay 6.2, you should reindex your portal's search
indexes. Liferay 6.2 indexes new information in many places, including
Documents and Media, Web Content, and Bookmarks. To reindex all search
indexes, navigate to the \emph{Control Panel} $\rightarrow$\emph{Server
Administration} and click on \emph{Reindex all search indexes}. This
invokes each of your portal's indexer classes, ensuring that your search
indexes contain the updated data that 6.2 indexes.

Do you have some troublesome required portlets running in your portal?
Wouldn't it be great if you could isolate them so they wouldn't affect
the overall health of your portal? We'll show you how to use Liferay's
Sandboxing feature to pen up those pesky portlets, next.

\section{Sandboxing Portlets to Ensure Portal
Resiliency}\label{sandboxing-portlets-to-ensure-portal-resiliency}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.25\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/ee-feature-web.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

The performance, health, and stability of a portal deployment is heavily
dependent upon the portlet modules deployed to it. If one portlet leaks
memory or is extremely slow, your entire portal can crash due to a
dreaded \texttt{OutOfMemoryError} or can slow to a crawl.

Liferay Portal 6.2 introduces a sandboxing feature that enables you to
run troublesome portlets in their own container (or ``sandbox''),
reducing any adverse impact they may have on the health and stability of
your portal. The feature is available in Liferay's Sandbox App. The app
lets you create sandboxes to run portlets in separate JVMs, freeing your
portal's JVM from the resource consumption of those portlets. We refer
to the portal's JVM instance as the \emph{Master Portal Instance}
(\emph{MPI}) and the sandbox JVMs as \emph{Slave Portal Instances}
(\emph{SPIs}). Since SPIs run on the same host as the MPI, communication
between them is very fast. The fact that sandboxed portlets are running
in SPIs is transparent to your users. Portal users continue to use these
portlets as they normally do.

As a portal administrator, you'll be pleased to know that the app not
only gives you the ability to section off plugins into SPIs, but also
gives you the means to revive a SPI. The Liferay Sandbox App comes with
a \emph{SPI Administration} UI that lets you create, start, stop, and
restart SPIs. In addition, it lets you configure options to restart SPIs
that terminate unexpectedly, automatically.

The sandboxing feature has two limitations. First, only portlet and web
plugins can be deployed on an SPI. Second, the portal ignores SPI
portlet implementation classes that are not remote-safe. Implementation
classes (such as asset renderers and pollers) that register with the
portal fall into this category and are ignored by the portal. Therefore,
the sooner you test and resolve any performance issues in such SPI
portlets, the sooner you can deploy them back onto the Master Portal
Instance to leverage such implementation classes in those portlets.

The Liferay Sandbox App is available on the Liferay
\href{http://www.liferay.com/marketplace}{Marketplace}. You can
purchase, install, and deploy the app as described in this guide's
chapter on
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/leveraging-the-liferay-marketplace}{Leveraging
the Liferay Marketplace}.

Before creating and using sandboxes, we must enable the portal's
resiliency functionality and optimize the database connection settings
for your sandboxes.

\subsection{Configuring the Portal for
Sandboxing}\label{configuring-the-portal-for-sandboxing}

The two types of portal properties you must modify for your portal to
use sandboxing are the
\href{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html\#Portal\%20Resiliency}{Portal
Resiliency} properties and
\href{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html\#JDBC}{Database
Connection} properties. You can set these in your
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file.

You must enable Portal Resiliency by setting the
\texttt{portal.resiliency.enabled} pro\-per\-ty to \texttt{true}. In
addition, you can optionally enable the portal to show special footers
in sandboxed portlets. The footers display at the bottom of each
sandboxed portlet, indicating the sandbox that is servicing the request.
The footer helps you verify that a portlet is sandboxed and which
sandbox it's in. To enable both of these resiliency properties, specify
the following entries in your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
portal.resiliency.enabled=true
portal.resiliency.portlet.show.footer=true
\end{verbatim}

If you hadn't previously configured your database connection pools using
your portal properties, you must do so in order to use the sandboxing
feature. If you've been using JNDI to configure data sources on your app
server, please convert to using Liferay's built-in data source by
specifying it via
\href{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html\#JDBC}{JDBC}
properties in your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. Note, if you
attempt to create or start a sandbox while having incorrect JDBC
settings, the Sandbox Administration console displays a warning.

After you've configured your portal for sandboxing and restarted it,
deploy the sandbox app. Then navigate to the Control Panel to see the
\emph{SPI Administration} link displayed in the \emph{Configuration}
section.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-spi-admin-available-in-control-panel.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.5: The Sandboxing App comes with an \emph{SPI
Administration} UI that's accessible from the portal's Control Panel.}
\end{figure}

Click the \emph{SPI Administration} link to start creating SPIs for
running new or troublesome portlets.

\subsection{Creating an SPI}\label{creating-an-spi}

You can create and administer SPIs from the SPI Administration page
accessible in the Configuration section of the Control Panel.

To add a new SPI, simply click on the \emph{Add SPI} button.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-add-spi-button.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.6: Click the \emph{Add SPI} button to define a new
``sandbox'' (SPI).}
\end{figure}

The Add SPI panel divides the SPI's fields into General, SPI
Configurations, and Advanced Configurations sections.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-add-spi-general-details.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.7: You can name your SPI, describe it, and configure
it from the \emph{Add SPI} panel.}
\end{figure}

In the General section, you must provide a unique name for the SPI and
describe the SPI.

The SPI Configurations contains some of the most important settings for
the SPI. It is broken into 4 sections: SPI Runtime, SPI Applications,
Java Runtime, and Recovery Options.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-configure-spi-runtime.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.8: From the \emph{SPI Runtime} section of your SPI,
you can set its maximum number of working threads based the number of
threads available to your portal that you'd like to designate for the
SPI. You must also set a unique connector port for the SPI.}
\end{figure}

Let's set the SPI's runtime options first.

\textbf{Maximum Worker Threads:} Enter the maximum number of worker
threads that the SPI can use to process requests. By default, it is set
to \texttt{100}. You should tune this value, however, according to the
number of threads allocated in the application server hosting your
portal. This parameter functions similarly to the settings in most JEE
application servers.

\textbf{Connector Port:} Enter the port number on which the SPI listens
for requests from Liferay Portal. Each SPI runs on an embedded Apache
Tomcat server instance. Each of the portal's SPIs must use a unique port
and you must ensure that no other processes are using that port.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note}: The SPIs and MPI serialize parameters and return values
passed between them. The sandboxing feature uses an IPC framework called
\href{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html\#Intraband}{Intraband},
to support communication between the MPI and SPIs.
\vspace{14pt}
\end{roundedframe}
Next, we'll pull those troublesome apps into the SPI.

The SPI Applications panel provides a way to select applications to be
hosted in the SPI. All requests that call these applications are
processed by the SPI.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-configure-spi-apps.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.9: All the portlets and web plugins that you've
installed on your portal are available for moving into a SPI.}
\end{figure}

The panel lists non-core portlets and web plugins that have been
installed on the portal. Since theme, layout template, hook, and Liferay
EXT plugins are not supported in the sandbox, they're excluded from this
list. In addition, the following applications are explicitly excluded:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \texttt{marketplace-portlet}
\item
  \texttt{resource-importer-web}
\item
  \texttt{spi-admin-portlet}
\item
  \texttt{spi-provider-web}
\item
  \texttt{wurfl-commercial-web}
\item
  \texttt{wurfl-web}
\end{itemize}

Next, we'll set the Java runtime resources for the SPI's JVM.

The \textbf{JVM Arguments} panel allows you to specify arguments to be
passed to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) running the SPI. These include
memory settings, debugger options, etc. If you do not specify any
values, the system automatically uses these values:

\begin{verbatim}
-Xmx512m -XX:PermSize=200m
\end{verbatim}

Consider the JVM's performance tuning recommendations when setting these
arguments. You can also consult the
\emph{Liferay Deployment Checklist} (available from the Customer Portal) for
guidance on setting the JVM arguments.

In development, you may also choose to add debug settings to the JVM
arguments.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-configure-spi-java-runtime.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.10: You can specify Java runtime options optimal for
your SPI's apps.}
\end{figure}

In the event that the SPI terminates unexpectedly, you may want to
consider automatically restarting it and having the Sandboxing App send
notifications to you and other stakeholders.

The Sandboxing App lets you configure email notifications for when an
SPI crashes and lets you configure for the app to automatically restart
the SPI.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-configure-spi-recovery.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.11: You can have the SPI notify you and others if the
SPI's apps crash it. And you can configure the maximum number of times
to automatically revive the SPI, before requiring manual intervention.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Use Default Notification Options:} Select this checkbox to use
the globally defined notification options. Otherwise the notification
options specified in this panel are used.

\textbf{Notification Recipients:} Enter a set of comma-delimited email
addresses of people to be notified in the event that the SPI fails. This
option is disabled if the \emph{Use Default Notification Options}
checkbox is selected.

\textbf{Use Default Restart Options:} Select this checkbox to use the
globally defined restart options. Otherwise the restart options
specified in this panel are used.

\textbf{Maximum Restart Attempts:} Enter the maximum number of times to
attempt restarting the SPI in the event that the SPI fails. Once Liferay
reaches the maximum number of restart attempts for the SPI, it refrains
from restarting the SPI. At that point, manual operator intervention is
required to restart it. This option is disabled if the \emph{Use Default
Restart Options} checkbox is selected.

\subsubsection{Advanced Configurations}\label{advanced-configurations}

The Advanced Configurations section contains a series of optional
parameters that should rarely be modified.

\textbf{Java Executable:} Enter the path to your JVM, specifically the
path to your Java executable file (i.e., the \texttt{java} or
\texttt{java.exe} file). You should generally not modify this value,
assuming your Java executable is in your system's \texttt{PATH}.

\textbf{SPI Ping Interval:} Enter the number of milliseconds to wait
between pings that the SPI sends to the portal to ensure the portal is
alive. Pinging the portal prevents SPIs from becoming ``zombie''
processes, in the event that the portal terminates unexpectedly.

\textbf{SPI Register Timeout:} Enter the number of milliseconds allotted
for the SPI to start. The default value is \texttt{300000} milliseconds
(\texttt{300} seconds). This should be ample time for a SPI to start.
However, if you have a large number of applications in the sandbox, or
the server has an insufficient CPU or insufficient memory resources, you
may need to increase the amount of time.

\textbf{SPI Shutdown Timeout:} Enter the maximum amount of time (in
milliseconds) that the SPI should need to gracefully shutdown. As with
the SPI Register Timeout, this value may need to be increased on slower
or overloaded machines.

You may also choose to allocate certain embedded Liferay functions
(e.g., blogs, bookmarks, etc.) to an SPI. This is generally not
recommended, but is made possible by the Sandboxing App. The SPI Core
Applications panel lets you drag apps onto the SPI in the same way you
can with the SPI Applications panel.

Now that you know how to add a SPI and configure it properly, let's
learn how to operate the SPI.

\subsection{Starting, Stopping, and Modifying an
SPI}\label{starting-stopping-and-modifying-an-spi}

The Portal automatically starts SPIs on startup. However, when you first
add a new SPI, you must start it manually.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-start-stop-spi.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.12: When you first create a SPI, you'll need to start
it manually. You can edit and delete SPIs that are not running.}
\end{figure}

Once successfully started, you can stop or restart a SPI. You can't,
however, delete an SPI that is running. You must first stop the SPI.

You can edit an SPI's configuration too. Configuration changes made to a
running SPI take effect after it's restarted.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-modify-spi.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.13: SPI configuration modifications only take affect
after the SPI has been restarted.}
\end{figure}

As you can see, operating SPIs is straightforward and easy to do.

If you have multiple SPIs, you may want to use global settings to
configure the default options for them. Let's consider how to configure
global settings for your SPIs next.

\subsection{Configure Global Settings}\label{configure-global-settings}

The SPI Administration console allows you to configure a series of
global settings. You can access them by clicking on the configuration
gear icon as shown in the figure below.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-global-settings.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.14: Click on the global settings gear icon, in the
upper right corner of the SPI Administration console, to set default
configuration options for all of the portal's SPIs.}
\end{figure}

Once you've opened the configuration panel, the SPI Administration
console enables you to configure global notification and set restart
options for your SPIs.

Note that option values explicitly configured in an SPI take precedence
over the global settings with respect to that SPI.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-global-recovery-options.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.15: You can set default notification and restart
options for all of the portal's SPIs.}
\end{figure}

Let's look at the global notification options first.

The notification options allow you to configure both the notfication
email content and specify the recipients of the notification email.
These values are used by all defined SPIs.

\textbf{Notification Email From Address:} Enter a default origin email
address to use for notification emails sent from the SPIs.

\textbf{Notification Email From Name:} Enter a default name to use for
the sender of the notification emails.

\textbf{Notification Recipients:} Enter a default comma-delimited list
of email addresses to receive the notification emails.

\textbf{Notification Email Subject:} Enter a subject template for the
notification emails.

\textbf{Notification Email Body:} Enter a body template for the
notification emails.

That's simple enough. Let's take a look at the restart options too.

The restart options section allows you to configure how many times each
SPI is restarted in the event that it terminates unexpectedly. In the
example below, all SPIs are restarted 3 times before requiring
administrator intervention to restart them.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-global-notification-options.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.16: Via the SPI Administration's global configuration
panel, you can set specific email notification options, including the
sender's address, the sender's name, default recipients, a default email
subject template, and a default email body template.}
\end{figure}

Let's recap what Liferay's Sandboxing App does for you. It lets you
isolate portlets and web plugins that are known troublemakers or that
you are simply just unsure about. You put them in their own sandbox JVM
(or SPI), so they can still be used in your portal but are kept out of
your portal's JVM. As an administrator, you can group plugins into SPIs
and configure each SPI's runtime, notification, and recovery options. In
addition, you can configure global default settings for your portal's
SPIs. With the Sandboxing App, you can ensure your portal's resiliency
while leveraging all the portlets (even leaky ones) that your users
require.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/sandboxing-global-restart-options.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.17: You can set default restart options for your SPIs
from the SPI Administration's global configuration panel.}
\end{figure}

Liferay Portal can serve portlets that are installed on the system, or
it can serve portlets installed on another portal server. This is called
Web Services for Remote Portlets. Have you ever wondered how to use WSRP
in Liferay? We'll cover this next!

\section{Using Web Services for Remote Portlets
(WSRP)}\label{using-web-services-for-remote-portlets-wsrp}

The Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) specification defines a web
service interface for accessing and interacting with
presentation-oriented web services in the form of portlets. What are
presentation-oriented web services? These are web services that send
user interfaces over the wire, rather than raw data like JSON objects or
SOAP data envelopes. If an application is written as a portlet, this is
an easy way to expose that application to end users on a completely
different system, rather than sending just the data and having to craft
an application to present that data. WSRP's presentation-oriented web
services allow portals to display remote portlets inside their pages, as
if locally deployed, without requiring any additional programming by
developers.

Here are the two main components for WSRP:

\emph{Producer:} A web service that exposes one or more portlets and is
described using a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) document.

\emph{Consumer:} A web service client that receives the data from the
Producer and presents it to the user in a portlet window.

Below, you'll see how the components interact with each other. So
without further ado, let's explore WSRP in Liferay!

\subsection{WSRP with Liferay}\label{wsrp-with-liferay}

Liferay provides a deployable WSRP portlet that supports the 1.0 and 2.0
specifications. The portlet is available from Liferay Marketplace as a
CE or EE app. Once you've downloaded and installed the WSRP app, you
have instant access to the portlet by navigating to the Control Panel
and, under \emph{Apps}, selecting \emph{WSRP}.

Liferay Portal can be used as a WSRP producer or consumer. As a
producer, it hosts portlets that are consumed by other portal servers
(Liferay or non-Liferay) acting as WSRP consumers. The image below
illustrates WSRP producers and consumers and how they interact.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/wsrp-illustration.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.18: Portlets can interact with other portlets located
on a different portal server using WSRP.}
\end{figure}

As we mentioned in the previous chapter, there are two main components
of the WSRP process: producers and consumers. Let's go through the basic
process of how producers and consumers work together to bring the end
user a remote portlet. First, the consumer portal server establishes a
connection with its producer portal server counterpart. This connection
is made possible by giving the consumer the producer portlet's URL. The
consumer then uses the URL to discover the producer's portlet and
establish a connection. After the connection is made, the consumer
acquires the producer's information and creates a consumer proxy
portlet. The proxy portlet acts as an intermediary, relaying requests to
and from the end user and the producer portlet.

For example, you can compare the proxy portlet to a TV satellite box. If
you want to change the channel on your TV, you (end user) send the
channel number you desire to the TV's satellite box (consumer's proxy
portlet) via your TV's remote. When the satellite box receives the
request to change the channel, it relays the request to a TV satellite
(producer's portlet) which then sends the channel information back to
the satellite box. Then, the satellite box displays the new channel to
you on your TV. In this simple example, you're not directly requesting
the TV satellite to change the channel, but rather, you're communicating
with the satellite box, which acts as an intermediary between you and
the satellite. This example directly relates to using WSRP with Liferay.
Although the end users are sending requests to the consumer portlet,
they're not receiving feedback from the consumer portlet itself, but
rather its producer portlet located remotely.

Now that you know a little bit about the WSRP process, let's begin
configuring WSRP on Liferay Portal. For this demonstration, we'll assume
you have two portal servers.

\clearpage

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Tip}: If you're following along with this example and don't have
an additional portal server, you can download another instance of
Liferay Portal and have it running at the same time as your current
Liferay instance to simulate an additional portal server. Remember,
typical use cases have WSRP producers and consumers linked on differing
portal servers. To run two portal instances locally at the same time,
you'll need to change one of your portal's server configurations.
Navigate to one of your portal's
\texttt{tomcat-{[}VERSION{]}\textbackslash{}conf\textbackslash{}server.xml}
and change the \texttt{port=} designations to different values (e.g.,
change \texttt{8080} to \texttt{18080}). Also, you can specify the new
port number for your browser launcher URL by adding
\texttt{browser.launcher.url=http://localhost:18080} to your portal's
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file.

\end{roundedframe}
To create a producer, go to the \emph{Producers} tab and click \emph{Add
Producer}. Give your producer a name and choose the appropriate version
of WSRP to use. Liferay displays a list of available portlets your
producer can use. For demonstration purposes, select the Hello World
portlet and click the \emph{Save} button. The portal generates a WSDL
document to define your producer. To view the WSDL document, click the
URL link provided.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/wsdl-url.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.19: You can view the WSDL document for your producer
by clicking the provided URL.}
\end{figure}

Now that we've created a producer, let's create a consumer on your
second portal server.

On your consumer portal server, navigate to the Consumers tab and select
the \emph{Add Consumer} button. Give it a name and add the producer's
WSDL URL in the \emph{URL} field. There are also additional fields:

\emph{Forward Cookies:} Allows the WSRP consumer to forward specific
cookies from the user's browser session to the WSRP producer.

\emph{Forward Headers:} Allows the WSRP consumer to forward specific
HTTP headers from the user's browser session to the WSRP producer.

\emph{Markup Character Sets:} Markup character encodings supported for
the consumer are shown in a comma delimited list. UTF-8 is assumed and
will be added automatically as a supported encoding.

Leave these additional fields blank for our demonstration. Lastly, we
need to define the portlets that the end-user can use from this
consumer. To do this, go to \emph{Actions} $\rightarrow$\emph{Manage Portlets} for
your consumer. Add the remote portlets that you've configured for your
producer portal server. In this case, select the \emph{Hello World}
remote portlet and give the new portlet an arbitrary name. Now end users
can ``consume'' or use the remote portlet just like any local portlet in
the portal.

Next, you'll learn how to create custom remote portlets.

\subsection{Creating Custom Remote
Portlets}\label{creating-custom-remote-portlets}

With the demand for dynamic portlets by end users, sometimes a finite,
pre-selected list of remote portlets isn't enough. Because of this,
Liferay allows you to make custom developed portlets remotely accessible
for WSRP.

To enable your custom portlet for WSRP, you'll need to add the
\texttt{\textless{}remoteable\textgreater{}}
tag to your portlet's \texttt{docroot/WEB-INF/liferay-portlet.xml} file:

\begin{verbatim}
<liferay-portlet-app>
    <portlet>
        <portlet-name>RemoteSamplePortlet</portlet-name>
        <remoteable>true</remoteable>
...
    </portlet>
...
</liferay-portlet-app>
\end{verbatim}

After editing your portlet's \texttt{liferay-portlet.xml} file, your
custom portlet will appear in the list of portlets available when
creating a WSRP producer. Congratulations! Now you can share all your
portlets to end users using WSRP!

Next, we'll learn how to remotely access Liferay services.

\section{Remotely Accessing Liferay
Services}\label{remotely-accessing-liferay-services}

Liferay includes a utility called the \emph{Service Builder} which is
used to generate all of the low level code for accessing resources from
the portal database. This utility is further explained in the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop}{\emph{Liferay
Developer Network}} and in \href{http://manning.com/sezov}{\emph{Liferay
in Action}}, but it is mentioned here because of its feature which
generates interfaces not only for Java code, but also for web services
and JavaScript. This means that the method calls for storing and
retrieving portal objects are all the same, and are generated in the
same step.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-soa-first-layer.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.20: Liferay SOA's first layer of security is its
properties files.}
\end{figure}

Because the actual method calls for retrieving data are the same
regardless of how one gets access to those methods (i.e., locally or
through web services), Liferay provides a consistent interface for accessing
portal data that few other products can match. The actual interfaces for the
various services are covered in the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop}{\emph{Liferay Developer Network}} and in
\href{http://manning.com/sezov}{\emph{Liferay in Action}}. Before these
services can be used, administrators need to enable users to access these
services remotely.

In the default \texttt{portal.properties} file, there is a section
called \textbf{Main Servlet}. This section defines the security settings
for all of the remote services provided by Liferay. Copy this section
and paste it into your custom \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. Then
you can edit the default values to configure the security settings for
the Axis Servlet, the Liferay Tunnel Servlet, the Spring Remoting
Servlet, the JSON Tunnel Servlet, and the WebDAV servlet.

By default, a user connecting from the same machine Liferay is running
on can access remote services so long as that user has the permission to
use those services in Liferay's permissions system. Of course, you are
not really ``remote'' unless you are accessing services from a different
machine. Liferay has two layers of security when it comes to accessing
its services remotely. Without explicit rights to both layers, a remote
exception will be thrown and access to those services will not be
granted.

The first layer of security that a user needs to get through in order to
call a method from the service layer is servlet security. The \emph{Main
Servlet} section of the \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file is used to
enable or disable access to Liferay's remote services. In this section
of the properties file, there are properties for each of Liferay's
remote services.

You can set each service individually with the security settings that
you require. For example, you may have a batch job which runs on another
machine in your network. This job looks in a particular shared folder on
your network and uploads documents to your site's Documents and Media
portlet on a regular basis, using Liferay's web services. To enable this
batch job to get through the first layer of security, you would modify
the \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file and put the IP address of the
machine on which the batch job is running in the list for that
particular service. For example, if the batch job uses the Axis web
services to upload the documents, you would enter the IP address of the
machine on which the batch job is running to the
\texttt{axis.servlet.hosts.allowed} property. A typical entry might look
like this:

\begin{verbatim}
axis.servlet.hosts.allowed=192.168.100.100, 127.0.0.1, SERVER_IP
\end{verbatim}

If the machine on which the batch job is running has the IP address
\texttt{192.168.100.100}, this configuration will allow that machine to
connect to Liferay's web services and pass in user credentials to be
used to upload the documents.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/liferay-soa-second-layer.png}
\caption{\\Figure 19.21: Liferay SOA's second layer of security is its
permissions system.}
\end{figure}

The second layer of security is Liferay's security model that it uses
for every object in the portal. The user account that accesses the
services remotely must have the proper permissions to operate on the
objects it attempts to access. Otherwise, a remote exception will be
thrown. Portal administrators need to use Liferay's permissions system
to grant access to these resources to the administrative user account
that attempts to operate on them remotely. For example, say that a
Documents and Media folder called \emph{Documents} has been set up in a
site. A role has been created called \emph{Document Uploaders} which has
the rights to add documents to this folder. Your batch job will be
accessing Liferay's web services in order to upload documents into this
folder. In order for this to work, you have to call the web service
using a user account to which the \emph{Document Uploaders} role has
been assigned (or that has individual rights to add documents to the
folder). Otherwise, you will be prevented from using the web service.

To call the web service using credentials, you would use the following
URL syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
http://" + userIdAsString + ":" + password +
"@<server.com\>:<port\>/tunnel-web/secure/axis/" + serviceName
\end{verbatim}

The user ID is the user's ID from Liferay's database. This can be
obtained by logging in as the user and navigating to the \emph{My
Account} portlet in the Control Panel. The user ID appears on the
Details page of the My Account portlet in the Control Panel.

For example, to get Organization data using a user that has the ID of
\emph{2} with a password of \emph{test}, you would use the following
URL:

\begin{verbatim}
http://2:test@localhost:8080/tunnel-web/secure/axis/Portal_OrganizationService
\end{verbatim}

It is important to note here how \emph{Password Policies} (covered in
this guide's chapter on
\href{https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/management-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-16-en}{User
Management} can be used in combination with this feature. If you are
enforcing password policies on your users (requiring passwords to take a
certain form, requiring users to change their passwords on a periodic
basis, etc.), any administrative user account which accesses Liferay's
web services in a batch job will have its password expire too.

To prevent this from happening, you can add a new password policy which
does not enforce the password expiration and add your administrative
user ID to it. Then your batch job can run as many times as you need it
to and the administrative user account's password will never expire.

In summary, accessing Liferay remotely requires the successful passing
of two security checks:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The IP address must be pre-configured in the server's
  \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file.\\
\item
  The user ID being used must have permission to access the resources it
  attempts to access.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Accessing Liferay's JSON Web
Services}\label{accessing-liferays-json-web-services}

To see which Liferay service methods are registered and available for
use via JSON web services, open your browser to the following address:

\begin{verbatim}
http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws
\end{verbatim}

The page lists the portal's registered and exposed service methods. Get
each method's details by clicking the method name. You can view the full
signature of each method, all its arguments, the exceptions that can be
thrown, and its Javadoc! Using a simple form from within your browser,
you can even invoke the service method for testing purposes.

To list registered services on a plugin (e.g.~a custom portlet), don't
forget to use its context path in your URL:

\begin{verbatim}
http://localhost:8080/[plugin-context]/api/jsonws
\end{verbatim}

This lists the JSON Web Service API for the plugin.

\subsection{Accessing Liferay's WSDL}\label{accessing-liferays-wsdl}

After configuring the security settings properly, your first step in
obtaining access to Life\-ray's remote SOAP web services is to access the
WSDL. If you are on a browser on the same machine Liferay is running on,
you can do this by accessing the following URL:

\begin{verbatim}
http://localhost:<port number\>/tunnel-web/axis
\end{verbatim}

If, for example, you are running on Tomcat on port 8080, you would
specify this URL:

\begin{verbatim}
http://localhost:8080/tunnel-web/axis
\end{verbatim}

If you are accessing a web service that was created as part of a portlet
plugin, the URL is similar, but uses the context of your application
rather than the tunnel-web servlet. You can get a list of your Service
Builder-generated WSDL documents by using the URL pattern below:

\begin{verbatim}
http://localhost:8080/your-portlet/axis
\end{verbatim}

If you are on a different machine from the Liferay server, you will need
to pass in your user credentials on the URL to access the WSDL:

\begin{verbatim}
http://<user ID\>:<password\>@<server name\>:<port number\>/tunnel-web/axis
\end{verbatim}

In any case, once you successfully browse to this URL, you will see the
list of web services. You can access the WSDL for each service by
clicking on the \emph{WSDL} link next to the name of the service. There
are many services; one for each of the services available from the
Liferay API.

Once you click on one of the \emph{WSDL} links, the Web Service
Definition Language document will be displayed. This document can be
used to generate client code in any language that supports it. You can
either save the document to your local machine and then generate the
client code that way, or use your tool to trigger Liferay to generate
the document dynamically by using one of the URLs above. For further
information about developing applications that take advantage of
Liferay's remote services, please see the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/develop}{\emph{Liferay Developer Network}}or
\href{http://manning.com/sezov}{\emph{Liferay in Action}}.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-19}

Liferay Portal is an easy environment to maintain. Backup procedures are
simple and straightforward. Administrators have all the options they
need to view and diagnose a running Liferay Portal server through its
tunable logs. Patching Liferay is easy to do with Liferay's patching
tool. It handles for you all the management of available patches, and
makes it easy to install and uninstall them. Upgrading Liferay is also a
snap, because Liferay does most of the work automatically. With easy
migration tools and automated database upgrade scripts, you'll have your
new version of Liferay Portal up and running in no time. It's also easy
and secure for Liferay administrators to remotely access both built-in
Liferay web services and custom services created using Service Builder.

\chapter{Using Scripting for Advanced
Flexibility}\label{using-scripting-for-advanced-flexibility}

Liferay provides a robust script engine that can be used to interpret
scripts in Beanshell, Javascript, Groovy, Python, and Ruby. The script
engine came out of Liferay's involvement with the
\href{http://www.ict-romulus.eu}{Romulus project}. It was originally
developed to support non Java-based portlets, but has now been extended
to handle a lot more. For example, when Liferay's workflow framework was
introduced, the script engine was leveraged to support the execution of
scripts from within a workflow module. A script console is now included
in the Server Administration portlet in the control panel. It allows
system administrators an easy way to execute scripts to perform
repetitive user maintenance operations, bulk manipulations using the
Liferay API to ensure consistency, or even system level operations.

This chapter helps you to understand Liferay's script engine and covers
the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Accessing Liferay's service layer from a script
\item
  Running scripts from the script console
\item
  Using the script engine with workflow
\item
  Leveraging custom Java tools in the script engine
\end{itemize}

The most common thing you'll want to do is access Liferay's services. If
you have any familiarity with Liferay's developer tools and API, this
will be a snap for you. To access Liferay's scripting console, navigate
to the Control Panel, click on \emph{Server Administration} under the
Configuration heading, then open the \emph{Script} tab.

\section{Accessing Liferay Services}\label{accessing-liferay-services}

In many cases, you'll want to interact with one of Liferay's many
services. This is possible from all of the scripting languages
supported, but the syntax is a little different for each language.

To illustrate the correct syntax for interacting with Liferay services,
let's look at a simple example that uses the \texttt{UserLocalService}
to retrieve a list of users and then prints their names to the log file.
We'll initially implement the example in Java pseudo-code.

\begin{verbatim}
import com.liferay.portal.model.User;
import com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil;
import java.util.List;
            .
            .
            .
                 int userCount = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount();
List<User> users = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsers(0, userCount);
     for (User user:users) {
    System.out.println("User Name: " + user.getFullName());
}
                 .
            .
            .
\end{verbatim}

Let's see first how this would work in Beanshell, which is very similar
to Java. 

\subsection{Beanshell}

Beanshell is a Java scripting language that's designed to run Java code
with little or no changes. In this example, we only have one small
change to make because Beanshell doesn't support the use of Java
Generics.

\begin{verbatim}
import com.liferay.portal.model.User;
import com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil;
import java.util.List;

int userCount = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount();
List users = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsers(0, userCount);
     for (User user:users) {
    System.out.println("User Name: " + user.getFullName());
}
\end{verbatim}

Next, we'll show the same thing in Groovy, another scripting language
designed to be similar to Java.

\subsection{Groovy}\label{groovy}

Groovy is also based on Java and is perhaps a little easier than
Beanshell because literally any code written in Java also runs in
Groovy. This means we can execute the exact same code from our Java
example without any changes.

\begin{verbatim}
import com.liferay.portal.model.User;
import com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil;
import java.util.List;

int userCount = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount();
List<User> users = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsers(0, userCount);
     for (User user:users) {
    System.out.println("User Name: " + user.getFullName());
} 
\end{verbatim}

Of course, we could make this somewhat Groovier by simplifying the
program as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
import com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil

userCount = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount()
users = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsers(0, userCount)
for (user in users){
    System.out.println("User Name: " + user.getFullName())
}
\end{verbatim}

The script engine supports more than just Java-like languages. Despite
the name, you should be aware that Javascript bears little resemblance
to Java, but you can still use it in Liferay's script engine.

\subsection{JavaScript}\label{javascript-1}

Liferay uses the Rhino JavaScript Engine to provide JavaScript support
in the script engine. The following code provides a JavaScript version
of our original Java program.

\begin{verbatim}
userCount = Packages.com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount(); 
users = new Packages.java.util.ArrayList;
users = Packages.com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsers(0, userCount);
user = Packages.com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil.createUser(0);

for (i=0;i<users.size();i++) {
    Packages.java.lang.System.out.println(users.get(i).getFullName());
}
\end{verbatim}

You can see the JavaScript example is compact. Ruby is even more
compact.

\subsection{Ruby}\label{ruby}

Ruby is supported through the use of JRuby and our previous example
could be implemented in Ruby as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
userCount = com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount();
users = com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsers(0, userCount);
users.each{ |user| print user.getFullName() + "\n"}
\end{verbatim}

Python users aren't left out either.

\subsection{Python}\label{python}

Lastly, Liferay provides Python support based on Jython and the previous
example could be implemented with the following code.

\begin{verbatim}
from com.liferay.portal.service import UserLocalServiceUtil
from com.liferay.portal.model import User

userCount = UserLocalServiceUtil().getUsersCount()
users = UserLocalServiceUtil().getUsers(0,userCount)

for user in users:
    print user.getFullName()
\end{verbatim}

As you can see, Liferay's services can be accessed from any of these
languages. Let's look at some practical examples of how you'd use this.

\section{Running Scripts from the Control
Panel}\label{running-scripts-from-the-control-panel}

To see a very simple example of the script console in action, log into
the portal as an administrator and navigate to the \emph{Control Panel}
$\rightarrow$\emph{Server Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Script}. Change the script type
to Groovy and replace the code in the scripting console with the
following:

\begin{verbatim}
number = com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount(); 
out.println(number); 
\end{verbatim}

Click the \emph{Execute} button and check the scripting console or the
log for the output.

Now let's implement a more realistic example. We'll retrieve some user
information from the database, make some changes and then update the
database with our changes. Our company has updated the terms of use and
requires that everyone be presented with the updated terms of use on the
next log in. When users agree to the terms of use, a boolean attribute
called \texttt{agreed\-To\-Terms\-Of\-Use} is set in their user records. As long
as the boolean is \texttt{true}, Liferay will not present the user with
the terms of use. However, if we set this flag to \texttt{false} for
everyone, all users will have to agree to it again to use the site.

We'll again use Groovy, so ensure that the script type is set to Groovy
and execute the following code to check the status of the
\texttt{agreedToTermsOfUse} user attribute:

\begin{verbatim}
import com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil

userCount = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount()
users = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsers(0, userCount)

for (user in users) {
    println("User Name: " + user.getFullName() + " -- " + user.getAgreedToTermsOfUse())
}
\end{verbatim}

The code above just prints the value of the \texttt{agreedToTermsOfUse}
attribute for each user. Next, we'll actually update each user in the
system to set his or her \texttt{agreed\-To\-Terms\-Of\-Use} attribute to
\texttt{false}. We'll be sure to skip the default user as the default
user is not required to agree to the Terms of Use. We'll also skip the
admin user that's currently logged in and running the script. If you're
logged in as someone other than test@liferay.com, be sure to update the
following script before running it. 

\begin{verbatim}
import com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil
userCount = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount()
users = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsers(0, userCount)

for (user in users){
         if(!user.isDefaultUser() && 
        !user.getEmailAddress().equalsIgnoreCase("test@liferay.com")) {
                         user.setAgreedToTermsOfUse(false)
            UserLocalServiceUtil.updateUser(user)
             }
         }
\end{verbatim}

To verify the script has updated the records, run the first script again
and you should see that all users (except the default user and your
user) have been updated.

That's all that's needed to run scripts and to access the Liferay
service layer. There are, however, some things to keep in mind when
working with the script console:~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There is no undo
\item
  There is no preview
\item
  When using Local Services, no permissions checking is enforced
\item
  Scripts are executed synchronously, so be careful with scripts that
  might take a long time to execute.~
\end{itemize}

For these reasons, you should use the script console with care. It's
best to test run your scripts on non-production systems before running
them on production. Of course, Liferay's script engine has uses beyond
the script console. Let's learn how to leverage Liferay's script engine
for designing workflows.

\section{Leveraging the Script Engine in
Workflow}\label{leveraging-the-script-engine-in-workflow}

Liferay's Kaleo workflow engine provides a robust system for reviewing
and approving content in an enterprise environment. Even if you don't
leverage custom scripts, it's a powerful and robust workflow solution.
Adding custom scripts takes it to the next level.

Examine the default Single Approver workflow definition included with
Kaleo for an overview of how the feature works. The final step in the
workflow runs a script that makes content available for use. As you can
see in the snippet below, it uses JavaScript to access the Java class
associated with the workflow to set the status of the content to
\emph{approved}.

\begin{verbatim}
<script>
<![CDATA[Packages.com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowStatusManagerUtil.updateStatus
    (Packages.com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowConstants.toStatus("approved"),
    workflowContext);]]>
</script>
<script-language>javascript</script-language>
\end{verbatim}

At virtually any point in a workflow, you can use Liferay's scripting
engine to access workflow APIs or other APIs outside of workflow. There
are a lot of different ways you could use this. Here are a few practical
ones:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Getting a list of users with a specific workflow-related role
\item
  Sending an email to the designated content approver with a list of
  people to contact if he is unable to review the content
\item
  Creating an alert to be displayed in the Alerts portlet for any user
  assigned to approve content
\end{itemize}

Of course, before you try any of this, you need to know the appropriate
syntax for inserting a script into a workflow. In an XML workflow
definition, a script can be used in any XML type that can contain an
\emph{actions} tag: those types are
\texttt{\textless{}state\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}task\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}fork\textgreater{}} and
\texttt{\textless{}join\textgreater{}}. Inside of one of those types,
format your script like this:

\begin{verbatim}
<actions>
    <action>
        <script>
            <![CDATA[*the contents of your script*]]>
        </script>
        <script-language>*your scripting language of choice*</script-language>
    </action>
    ...
</actions>
\end{verbatim}

Here's an example of a workflow script created in Groovy. This one is
designed to be used with a \texttt{Condition} statement in Kaleo. It
accesses Liferay's asset framework to determine the category of an asset
in the workflow. The script uses the category to automatically determine
the correct approval process. If the category \texttt{legal} has been
applied to the asset, the asset is sent to the \texttt{Legal Review}
task upon submission. Otherwise, the asset is sent to the
\texttt{Default Review} task.

\begin{verbatim}
    <script>
        <![CDATA[
            import com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.GetterUtil;
            import com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowConstants;
            import com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowHandler;
            import com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowHandlerRegistryUtil;
            import com.liferay.portlet.asset.model.AssetCategory;
            import com.liferay.portlet.asset.model.AssetEntry;
            import com.liferay.portlet.asset.model.AssetRenderer;
            import com.liferay.portlet.asset.model.AssetRendererFactory;
            import com.liferay.portlet.asset.service.AssetEntryLocalServiceUtil;

            import java.util.List;

            String className = (String)workflowContext.get(
                WorkflowConstants.CONTEXT_ENTRY_CLASS_NAME);

            WorkflowHandler workflowHandler =
                WorkflowHandlerRegistryUtil.getWorkflowHandler(className);

            AssetRendererFactory assetRendererFactory =
                workflowHandler.getAssetRendererFactory();

            long classPK =
                GetterUtil.getLong((String)workflowContext.get
                (WorkflowConstants.CONTEXT_ENTRY_CLASS_PK));

            AssetRenderer assetRenderer =
                workflowHandler.getAssetRenderer(classPK);

            AssetEntry assetEntry = assetRendererFactory.getAssetEntry(
                assetRendererFactory.getClassName(), assetRenderer.getClassPK());

            List<AssetCategory> assetCategories = assetEntry.getCategories();

            returnValue = "Default Review";

            for (AssetCategory assetCategory : assetCategories) {
                String categoryName = assetCategory.getName();

                if (categoryName.equals("legal")) {
                    returnValue = "Legal Review";

                    return;
                }
            }
           ]]>
    </script>
    <script-language>groovy</script-language>
\end{verbatim}

Within a workflow, the next task or state is chosen based on the return
value. For a complete example a workflow script that uses the above
Groovy script, please see the \texttt{legal-workflow-script.xml} file in
the User Guide's code folder on Github.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/blob/master/userGuide/code/legal-workflow-script.xml}}

The combination of Liferay's scripting and workflow engines is
incredibly powerful. However, since it provides users with the ability
to execute code, it can be dangerous. When configuring your permissions,
be aware of the potential consequences of poorly, or maliciously,
written scripts inside of a workflow definition. For more information on
creating workflow definitions with Kaleo workflow, see the chapter on it in
this guide.

\section{Custom Java Tools in the Script
Engine}\label{custom-java-tools-in-the-script-engine}

Users of the Script Engine face several challenges, including debugging
and logging challenges. One approach to overcome these challenges is to
develop custom Java utilities that can be called from your scripts.
These utilities can write to a custom log file or the Liferay log file.
You can also place breakpoints in your utility code and step through it
using your favorite debugger.

Liferay's use of Spring and \texttt{PortletBeanLocatorUtil} makes
calling these Java utilities from your script easy, regardless of the
scripting language you're using.

Let's begin by creating a Liferay Hook project. If you're using Liferay
IDE or Liferay Developer Studio, select \emph{File} $\rightarrow$\emph{New} →
\emph{Liferay Project}. Name the project \emph{script-utils} and accept
the display name generated by the wizard. Be sure to select \emph{Hook}
for the Plugin Type and then select \emph{Finish}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/13-new-liferay-project.png}
\caption{\\Figure 20.1: Creating a new utilities project is easy if you
use Liferay IDE or Liferay Developer Studio.}
\end{figure}

You're using a Liferay Hook Plugin to deploy your utility, but you're
not using any of the typical hook features. You just need a way to make
your code available to the portal and the Hook Plugin is the least
obtrusive way to do this. This means you don't need to add anything to
the \texttt{liferay-hook.xml} file. Instead, you'll begin by adding your
utility code.

You'll be following the Dependency Injection design pattern so begin by
creating the interface. Right-click on the \texttt{docroot/WEB-INF/src}
folder and select \emph{New} $\rightarrow$\emph{Interface}. You'll create your
interface in the \texttt{com.liferay.sample} package. Name it
\texttt{ScriptUtil}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/13-new-interface.png}
\caption{\\Figure 20.2: Create a new Java interface which you'll implement
in the next step.}
\end{figure}

Next, add two methods to the interface.

\begin{verbatim}
package com.liferay.sample;

public interface ScriptUtil {

    public String operationOne(); 
         public String operationTwo(String name); 

}
\end{verbatim}

Next, create the implementation class. Right-click on the
\texttt{docroot/WEB-INF/src} folder and select \emph{New} →
\emph{Class}. Create the class in the \texttt{com.liferay.sample}
package and name it \texttt{ScriptUtilImpl}. Be sure to select
\texttt{com.liferay.sample.ScripUtil} as the Interface.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/13-new-class.png}
\caption{\\Figure 20.3: Create a new Java Class that implements the
interface you created earlier.}
\end{figure}

Next, add implementations for the two methods.

\begin{verbatim}
package com.liferay.sample;

import com.liferay.portal.kernel.log.Log;
import com.liferay.portal.kernel.log.LogFactoryUtil;

public class ScriptUtilImpl implements ScriptUtil {

    @Override
    public String operationOne() { 
                 return "Hello out there!"; 
    } 

    @Override
    public String operationTwo(String name) { 

        _log.debug("Inside of Operation Two");
                     return "Hello " + name + "!"; 
    }
             private static Log _log = LogFactoryUtil.getLog(ScriptUtilImpl.class); 

}
\end{verbatim}

Liferay makes extensive use of the Spring Framework and you'll be using
it here to inject your implementation class into the application. Spring
needs a bean definition which you'll declare in an XML file named
\texttt{hook-spring.xml}. Create a \texttt{doc\-root/WEB-INF\-/src\-/ME\-TA-INF}
directory, create the \texttt{hook-spring.xml} file in this folder, and
add the following code to \texttt{hook-spring.xml}:

\begin{verbatim}
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        default-destroy-method="destroy" default-init-method="afterPropertiesSet"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans 
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">
        <bean id="com.liferay.sample.ScriptUtil" class="com.liferay.sample.ScriptUtilImpl" />
</beans>
\end{verbatim}

Upon deployment, you'll need the portal to create a \texttt{BeanLocator}
for your plugin. The \texttt{BeanLocator} reads the bean definitions you
provided. Create a \texttt{doc\-root\-/WEB-INF\-/web.xml} file in your project
and add the following code to it:

\begin{verbatim}
<web-app version="2.4" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee 
    http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd">
        <context-param>
                <param-name>portalContextConfigLocation</param-name>
                <param-value>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/hook-spring.xml</param-value>
        </context-param>
</web-app>
\end{verbatim}

If your project already contains a \texttt{docroot/WEB-INF/web.xml}
file, you can simply add the contents of the
\texttt{\textless{}context-param\textgreater{}} element inside of the
\texttt{\textless{}web-app\textgreater{}} element. Save all of the
changes you've made and deploy the hook. Once the hook has been deployed
successfully, the \texttt{ScriptUtil} can be used in your script engine
code.

To see the \texttt{ScriptUtil} code in action, navigate back to the
\emph{Control Panel} $\rightarrow$\emph{Server Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Script}.
Change the script type to Groovy and enter the following script:

\begin{verbatim}
myUtil = com.liferay.portal.kernel.bean.PortletBeanLocatorUtil.locate(
    "script-utils-hook", "com.liferay.sample.ScriptUtil")

println(myUtil.operationOne())

println(myUtil.operationTwo("Joe Bloggs"))
\end{verbatim}

Click \emph{Execute} and you should see the results of your script
displayed right under the script console.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-20}

In this chapter, we saw how Liferay's script engine opens up many
exciting possibilities for working with Liferay. You can write and
execute scripts from Liferay's Script console in the Control Panel using
in a variety of languages including Beanshell, Javascript, Groovy,
Python, and Ruby. We learned how you can leverage Liferay's Services
Oriented Architecture (SOA) from any of the popular scripting languages
that Liferay supports. We also saw how those scripts could be used to
simplify administrative tasks by leveraging the Script console. Next, we
discovered how you could enhance workflow by using the power of scripts.
Lastly, we saw how you could overcome some of the limitations of running
scripts in Liferay by creating custom Java utilities that could be
executed from within your scripts.

As you can see, Liferay's script engine opens up many exciting
possibilities for working with Liferay regardless of your language of
choice.

\chapter{Managing Liferay with Liferay Cloud
Services}\label{managing-liferay-with-liferay-cloud-services}

Liferay Cloud Services (LCS) is a set of tools and services that lets
you manage and monitor your Liferay installations. While Liferay's
patching tool lets you apply fix packs and other updates, the install
process is still manual. LCS simplifies this process by automatically
installing any fix packs that you \emph{choose}. That last point is an
important one--LCS won't install anything that you don't specifically
choose for installation. You still have control over what gets applied
to your Liferay installations. LCS just automates the process by
enabling one-click downloading and updating. You can also use LCS to
monitor the performance of your Liferay instances. This includes data on
pages, portlets, memory usage, JVM performance, and much more. Even
better, the features of LCS work regardless of whether your Liferay
instance is on a single discreet server, or distributed across a node.

Before going any further, you should make sure that your Liferay
instances meet the requirements for LCS--you must be running Liferay
Portal 6.1 GA 3, or 6.2 GA 1 or above. Using LCS to apply fix packs and
other updates is an EE only feature. The monitoring features of LCS are
available to both Liferay CE and EE.

Also, you should take note of a few key terms used throughout this
guide:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{Project}: Represents a group of users belonging to a company or
  organization. For example, a project can consist of all the users from
  a project team or business unit, or it can include the entire company.
\item
  \emph{Environment}: Represents a physical cluster of servers, or a
  virtual or logical aggregation of servers.
\item
  \emph{Server}: Describes a concrete portal instance. It can be a
  standalone server or a cluster node.
\end{itemize}

As you go through this guide, you'll cover the following sections on
LCS:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  LCS Account Setup
\item
  Portal Preconfiguration (Liferay 6.1 GA3 only)
\item
  Patching Tool Configuration (EE only)
\item
  LCS Client Configuration
\item
  Using LCS
\end{itemize}

Next, you'll get started by setting up your LCS account.

\section{Setting up Your LCS Account}\label{setting-up-your-lcs-account}

To use LCS, you first need to have an account at
\href{http://www.liferay.com/}{Liferay.com}. You then need to set up an
LCS account at \href{https://lcs.liferay.com}{lcs.liferay.com}. When
creating an LCS account, you're taken through the steps of accepting the
terms of service, setting your password, and setting your password
reminder. You're then taken to the \emph{Projects} screen where you can
join an existing project or create a new one.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-projects.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.1: When creating your LCS account, you can join an
existing project or create a new one.}
\end{figure}

The list of existing projects, if present, is the list of projects
associated with the domain of your email address. This is typically the
company your email address is associated with. For example, if your
email address is \texttt{joebloggs@janesblogfactory.com}, you're then
presented with a list of existing projects registered to users with the
\texttt{@janes\-blog\-fac\-to\-ry\-.com} domain. This lets you quickly and easily
join the LCS projects that are associated with your company. To request
access to a project, simply check its checkbox and click \emph{Save}.
Your request is then sent to the project administrator for approval.
Note that it's possible for the project administrator to pre-assign you
a role in a project (more on LCS roles in a moment). In this case, you
won't have to wait for approval. For more information on user management
in LCS, please see the \emph{Managing LCS Users in Your Project} section
of this guide.

Alternatively, you can create a new project and make yourself its
administrator. To do so, click the checkbox next to \emph{Create a
project and become an administrator} in the New Project section of the
Projects screen. The section then expands to let you name the project
and choose to go to directly to the project's \emph{Dashboard} (more on
the Dashboard later). Give your project a name and then click
\emph{Save}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-new-project.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.2: You can also create a new project from the
Projects screen.}
\end{figure}

So what exactly can an LCS Administrator do? Fantastic question! As LCS
Administrator, you can assign roles to the rest of the users in your
project. Each user of LCS needs to have an assigned role. The following
roles are available:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  LCS Administrator: All LCS functionality is available to
  administrators. This is the only role that can manage the roles of
  other users.
\item
  LCS Environment Manager: All LCS functionality is available in the
  scope of an environment, with the exception of managing other users.
\item
  LCS Environment Viewer: Has read-only access in the scope of an
  environment.
\end{itemize}

You should note that each of these LCS roles assume that the user
already has the LCS User role in his or her Liferay.com account. The LCS
User role is granted automatically the first time the user enters their
LCS account. The actions that can be performed by each of the LCS roles
are detailed in the below permissions matrix.

\begin{landscape}
\textbf{LCS Permissions Matrix}

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Action & ~LCS Administrator & ~LCS Environment Manager & ~LCS 
Environment Viewer\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Access LCS & true & true & true\tabularnewline
Access Any Environment & true & false & false\tabularnewline
Access a Particular Environment & true & true & true\tabularnewline
Manage Users in Any Environment & true & false & false\tabularnewline
Manage Users in a Particular Environment & true & true &
false\tabularnewline
Invite Users to LCS & true & false & false\tabularnewline
Create and Delete Environments & true & false & false\tabularnewline

false\tabularnewline
Install Fix Packs in Any Environment & true & false &
false\tabularnewline
Install Fix Packs in a Particular Environment & true & true &
false\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\end{landscape}

Now that your LCS account has been set up and you have an understanding
of the LCS roles, you can get your portal ready for LCS.

\section{Preconfiguring Your Portal for
LCS}\label{preconfiguring-your-portal-for-lcs}

If you're running Liferay 6.2, then you can skip this step. If, however,
you are running Liferay 6.1 GA3, then there's a small pre-configuration
step that you need to take before using LCS: you need to update the
\texttt{spring.configs} property in your \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties}
file. This is a workaround for a bug in Liferay 6.1 GA3, where the
values for this property are listed in the wrong order. This causes the
metrics service in LCS to not be initialized. To fix this, add the
following configuration to your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
spring.configs=\
    META-INF/base-spring.xml,\
    \
    META-INF/hibernate-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/infrastructure-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/management-spring.xml,\
    \
    META-INF/util-spring.xml,\
    \
    META-INF/jpa-spring.xml,\
    \
    META-INF/executor-spring.xml,\
    \
    META-INF/audit-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/cluster-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/editor-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/jcr-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/ldap-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/messaging-core-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/messaging-misc-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/mobile-device-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/notifications-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/poller-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/rules-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/scheduler-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/scripting-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/search-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/workflow-spring.xml,\
    \
    META-INF/counter-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/mail-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/portal-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/portlet-container-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/staging-spring.xml,\
    META-INF/virtual-layouts-spring.xml,\
    \
    META-INF/monitoring-spring.xml,\
    \
    #META-INF/dynamic-data-source-spring.xml,\
    #META-INF/shard-data-source-spring.xml,\
    #META-INF/memcached-spring.xml,\
    \
    META-INF/ext-spring.xml
\end{verbatim}

A server restart is required after updating
\texttt{portal-ext.properties}. Next, you need to configure the patching
tool.

\section{Configuring the Patching
Tool}\label{configuring-the-patching-tool}

Liferay EE's patching tool is leveraged by LCS to apply its updates. If
you're running a Liferay EE bundle, then you already have the patching
tool installed. If you're not running a bundle, then please see the LDN section
on
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/6-2/patching-liferay#installing-the-patching-tool}{how
to install the patching tool}. Once you have the patching tool
installed, there are a few steps you need to complete before LCS can use
it. Note that the commands below apply to Linux, Unix, and Mac systems.
If you're running Windows, simply drop the \texttt{.sh} from each
command that has it.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Navigate to the \texttt{patching-tool} directory on the command line.
  It's typically located in the Liferay Home folder.
\item
  Make sure that you have version 10 or higher of the patching tool. To
  display the version of your patching tool, run
  \texttt{patching-tool.sh info}.
\item
  Configure the patching tool by running
  \texttt{patching-tool.sh setup}.
\item
  Patches downloaded through LCS are installed by the patching tool
  agent on server startup. For the agent to start with your server, you
  need to set the \texttt{javaagent} property in the JVM options. Make
  sure that you specify the correct file path to the
  \texttt{patching-tool-agent.jar}. Here's an example of setting the
  \texttt{javaagent} property:

\begin{verbatim}
-javaagent:../../patching-tool/lib/patching-tool-agent.jar
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

If your patching tool is installed in a location other than the Liferay
Home folder, you must specify the path of the \texttt{patching-tool}
folder as a JVM argument for the app server. This is done with the
\texttt{patching.tool.home} property. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
    -Dpatching.tool.home=/opt/liferay-portal-6.1.20-ee-ga2/patching-tool/
\end{verbatim}

Great! Now you're all set to deploy and configure the LCS client
portlet.

\section{Configuring the LCS Client}\label{configuring-the-lcs-client}

You're now ready to configure the LCS client for use in your portal. If
your server accesses the web through a proxy, then you need to set a
couple of properties inside the WAR file of the LCS client portlet.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-post-install-01.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.3: LCS appears in your Control Panel as Liferay Cloud
Services, in the Apps section.}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In the WAR file of the LCS client portlet, open the
  \texttt{WEB-INF/clas\-ses/port\-let\-ext\-.pro\-per\-ties} file.
\item
  At the end of the file, add the following properties and set them to
  the appropriate values for your proxy. proxy.host.name=
  proxy.host.port=
\item
  Update LCS client WAR with the modified
  \texttt{portlet-ext.properties} file.
\item
  Deploy the LCS client WAR, or redeploy it if it's already deployed.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/lcs-auth-access.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.4: The LCS client portlet requires access to your LCS
account.}
\end{figure}

Once you deploy the LCS client portlet, you can use it to register your
server with your LCS account. Access the portlet by clicking on
\emph{Liferay Cloud Services} under the \emph{Apps} section of the
\emph{Control Panel}.

After clicking \emph{Authorize Access} on the screen that appears, you
are then taken to the LCS website. Log in with your credentials and then
click \emph{Grant Access}.

Next, you need to register your server with LCS by filling out the
following fields:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Cloud Services Project: Choose your project from the menu.
\item
  Environment: Select an environment from the menu or create a new one
  by clicking the \emph{Add New Environment} button. An environment
  should be a logical group of servers. A group of development servers
  or a cluster are good examples of environments. If you elect to create
  a new environment, a popup asks you to enter its \emph{Name},
  \emph{Location}, and \emph{Description}.

\item
  Server Name: Give your server a name that you can use to distinguish
  it in your LCS account.
\item
  Server Location: This can be a city, location in an office building,
  or anywhere else that lets you know where the server is physically
  located.
\item
  Server Description: Type in any description that you want to give your
  server. You can use this field to help differentiate the servers you
  are managing using LCS.
\end{enumerate}

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/lcs-new-environment.png}
  \caption{\\Figure 21.5: The Add New Environment pop-up.}
  \end{figure}

Upon clicking \emph{Register}, your LCS client portlet shows your
connection status. Note that it can take up to 10 or 20 seconds to
perform the initial handshake with LCS and send the first batch of
information to the cloud. If you don't see any change in status after 20
seconds, try refreshing the page. If you see a red symbol indicating no
data is being transmitted, please contact the Liferay team for support.

Once a successful connection is established, some statistics and links
are displayed. Here's a description of what's displayed:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Heartbeat Interval: The communication interval with LCS. For example,
  if this value is \texttt{00:01:00}, then the portlet communicates with
  LCS once every minute.
\item
  Message Task Interval: The message interval with LCS. Messages
  received from LCS let the portlet know about any available updates.
\item
  Metrics Task Interval: The interval at which server statistics and
  metrics are taken.
\item
  Project: Clicking this link takes you to this server's registered
  project.

\item
  Environment: Clicking this link takes you to this server's registered
  environment.
\item
  Server: Clicking this link takes you to the server on LCS.
\item
  Disconnect: Disconnects this Liferay instance from LCS.
\item
  Reset Credentials: Removes the authorizing account from registration
  with LCS. It's important to note that your credentials are not human
  readable in the portal instance. This is because OAuth, which uses
  tokens, is used for authentication.
\end{itemize}

Great! Now that you've registered your server with your LCS account, you
can dig in to the features of LCS.

\section{Using LCS}\label{using-lcs}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in]{../../images/lcs-register-server.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.6: The server registration screen.}
\end{figure}

Once your LCS client is registered with your LCS account, you can get
down to the business that LCS was designed for--managing and monitoring
your Liferay instance. If you're not already there, log in with your
account on \href{https://lcs.liferay.com}{lcs.liferay.com}. This is
where you'll apply updates, view server metrics, manage environments,
invite external users to your project, and more.

At this point, you might be wondering what information about your
servers is stored on the LCS servers. Great question! In order to offer
the best service possible, we store the following information about your
servers: patches installed on each server, \texttt{por\-tal.pro\-per\-ties}
(except sensitive data), JVM metrics, portal and portlet metrics, and
cache and server metrics. Sensitive data is defined as any key-value
pair that contains usernames or passwords. For example, the following
properties are considered sensitive and are not stored on the LCS
servers:

\begin{verbatim}
omniadmin.users
ldap.security.credentials.0, ldap.security.credentials.1, ldap.security.credentials.2 ...
facebook.connect.app.secret
auth.token.shared.secret
auth.mac.shared.key
captcha.engine.recaptcha.key.private
amazon.secret.access.key
tunneling.servlet.shared.secret
microsoft.translator.client.secret
dl.store.s3.secret.key
auto.deploy.glassfish.jee.dm.passwd
\end{verbatim}

Also, any properties that end in \texttt{.password} and are not stored,
with the exception of the following non-sensitive properties:

\begin{verbatim}
portal.jaas.plain.password
portal.jaas.strict.password
login.create.account.allow.custom.password
\end{verbatim}

Now that you know what information is stored on the LCS servers, it's
time to get to the heart of LCS--the \emph{Dashboard}.

The LCS Dashboard lets you view and manage your project, environments,
and servers. If you're not already at the Dashboard, click it near the
upper left-hand corner of your LCS site. Clicking \emph{Dashboard} takes
you to the project view. From there, you can get to the environment view
and the server view. Each of these views gives you a different look into
certain aspects of your LCS project. You'll start with the project view.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/lcs-server-connecting.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.7: The server is connecting to LCS.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Using the Project View}\label{using-the-project-view}

You can get to the project view at any time by clicking the Dashboard
tab near the upper left-hand corner of your LCS site. The project view
provides you with an overview of your LCS project, including fix packs,
alerts, environments, and servers. Fix packs are displayed prominently
in a table on the middle of the page. Note that the status, environment,
server, and location are listed for each fix pack. If the fix pack is
available, you can download it by clicking the Download button to its
right. Once a fix pack is finished downloading, an alert appears in the
Alerts table below the fix packs table. This notification tells you the
download is finished and to restart your server. Restarting your server
installs any downloaded fix packs. Note that you must start your server
with the privileges required to write to the disk location where patches
are stored and processed (the \texttt{patching-tool} folder).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/lcs-server-connected.png}
   \caption{\\Figure 21.8: The server is connected to LCS.}
\end{figure}

But what about using LCS to install fix packs across a cluster? Just
follow the same procedure! LCS downloads and installs fix packs
simultaneously across all nodes--you don't have to handle each one
individually.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-project-view.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.9: The LCS project view shows an overview of your LCS
project.}
\end{figure}

In addition to displaying fix pack messages, the Alerts table also
displays many other kinds of messages. For example, an alert appears
whenever a server is offline. Since this is an important message, it
appears with a red dot next to it. Other alerts appear when monitoring
is unavailable, the patching tool is unavailable, or other issues are
detected.

To the left of the fix packs and alerts are the environments in your
project. You can also create new environments here by clicking the blue
plus icon. If you look at the icons next to each environment, you'll
notice that they're not all the same. In fact, the color and type of the
icon tells you something about that environment:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Red icon: Indicates that there is some sort of problem or issue with
  one or more servers in that environment.
\item
  Green icon: Indicates that the servers in that environment are
  operating properly.
\item
  Icon with a circle: Indicates that the servers in that environment are
  in a cluster.
\end{itemize}

You can get more information about a specific environment by clicking
it. This takes you to the environment view.

\subsection{Using the Environment
View}\label{using-the-environment-view}

Clicking an environment on the left-hand side of the project view takes
you to the environment view. The environment view, as its name implies,
gives you more information about an environment in your LCS project. As
with the project view, fix packs and alerts are displayed on the center
of the screen. In fact, they behave exactly the same here as they do in
the project view. The only difference is that they show fix packs and
alerts for the environment instead of the project as a whole. Located
above the fix packs, the Environment Details button lets you edit or
delete the environment. To the left of the fix packs is the list of
servers in the environment. Clicking on one of the servers takes you to
the server view for that server.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-environment-view.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.10: The LCS environment view shows an overview of an
LCS environment.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Using the Server View}\label{using-the-server-view}

The server view provides you with detailed information about a server,
including statistics and performance metrics. You can get to the server
view by clicking a server in the environment view or by clicking a
server in the fix pack or alerts tables. Fix packs and alerts are the
first thing you see here, as the Fix Packs Alerts button is selected by
default when you enter server view. While the alerts table functions the
same as it does in the other views, the fix packs table behaves a bit
differently. Fix packs are broken down into those that are available for
installation and those that are already installed. You can access these
through the \emph{Available} and \emph{Installed} tabs at the top of the
fix packs table.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-server-view.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.11: The LCS server view shows an overview of a server
registered with LCS.}
\end{figure}

To view metrics and statistics of your server's performance, click the
\emph{Metrics} button near the top of the page. The metrics are broken
down into three main categories: \emph{Application}, \emph{JVM}, and
\emph{Server}. Application is selected by default when you click the
Metrics button.

The Application category also has three other categories within
it: \emph{Pages}, \emph{Portlets}, and \emph{Cache}. Pages lists the
frequency with which specific pages are loaded, along with their average
load time. Portlets lists the same statistics, but for specific portlets
in your server. The Cache category lists Liferay Single VM metrics and
Hibernate metrics. In the following screenshot, the statistics in the
Portlet category are shown.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-server-metrics-application-portlets.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.12: The LCS application metrics show portlet
performance statistics, like frequency of use and average load time.}
\end{figure}

The JVM category, as its name indicates, shows statistics about the JVM
running on your server. This includes data on the garbage collector and
memory. The number of runs, total time, and average time are listed for
each garbage collector item. The memory metrics are presented in a bar
chart that shows the usage of the Code Cache, PS Eden Space, PS Old Gen,
PS Perm Gen, and PS Survivor Space.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-server-metrics-jvm.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.13: The LCS JVM metrics show performance data for
memory and the garbage collector.}
\end{figure}

Server is the third category in the Application category. The Server
category shows additional information about how your server is running.
For example, a horizontal bar graph shows the number of current threads
that are running on your server. Similarly, horizontal bar graphs are
used to represent the JDBC connection pools.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-metrics-server.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.14: The LCS server metrics show current threads and
JDBC connection pools.}
\end{figure}

You can also view the settings for a server by clicking on the
\emph{Server Details} button, which is to the right of the Metrics
button. The first tab under the Settings button is \emph{LCS Server
Settings}. This lets you view or edit your server's name, description,
and location. You can also unregister your server from LCS. The second
tab under the Settings button is \emph{About Server}. This provides
general information about your Liferay instance and hardware. This
information is useful to the Liferay support team in the event that you
need their assistance.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-server-details-settings.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.15: You can view and edit the details of your server
registered with LCS.}
\end{figure}

As you can see, the LCS Dashboard is a powerful tool that greatly
simplifies the update process and also gives you extensive information
on how your servers are running. Next you'll take a look at how to
manage the users in your LCS project.

\subsection{Managing LCS Users in Your
Project}\label{managing-lcs-users-in-your-project}

The Users section of LCS is where you manage the LCS users that are part
of your project. It's here that you can grant or revoke LCS roles or
invite others that aren't yet part of your project. To manage users,
first click the \emph{Users} icon just below the Dashboard icon on the
upper-left of your screen. You're presented with a table of the users on
your project. To the right of each is the Manage button. Clicking
\emph{Manage} lets you assign or revoke LCS roles for that user.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-users.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.16: The Users tab lets you manage the LCS users in
your project.}
\end{figure}

To invite external users to your project, click on the \emph{Invite}
button. The \emph{Invite User} pop up lets you invite anyone with a
valid email address. You can also search for Liferay.com users to
invite. Once you've chosen some users, the \emph{Role} selection box
lets you preassign LCS roles for when they accept your invitation.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-invite-users.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.17: You can invite users to your LCS project and even
preassign them roles.}
\end{figure}

To view sent invitations, click the \emph{Invitations} tab. A table
displays invitations, listing invited users' email addresses along with
who invited them and the date that the invitation was sent. The table
also shoes the preassigned LCS role and environment. You can cancel an
invitation by clicking the red \emph{Cancel} button in the \emph{Action}
column of the invitation.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/lcs-invitations.png}
\caption{\\Figure 21.18: The Invitations tab lets administrators view and
cancel invitations.}
\end{figure}

As you've now seen, LCS is a powerful tool that simplifies the
management of your Liferay servers. You can apply fix packs with just a
single click and a server restart--a process that even works across a
cluster. You also get a one stop shop for monitoring the performance of
your Liferay servers. Metrics like JVM performance, Liferay page and
portlet load times, and number of current threads give you an inside
look at how your server is running. What's more is that you can do all
this collaboratively by inviting others to your project and giving them
specific roles in LCS.

Next, you'll learn about Liferay clustering.

\chapter{Configuring Liferay for High
Availability}\label{configuring-liferay-for-high-availability}

Liferay Portal is a robust, enterprise-ready portal solution. As such,
it is fully ready to support mission-critical, enterprise applications
in an environment configured for multiple redundancies and 24/7 uptimes.
The product, however, like other products of its kind, doesn't come
configured this way out of the box, so there are some steps that need to
be taken to tune it for your needs.

This chapter covers these topics in detail. Liferay runs on so many
different Java EE application servers that we can't cover all the
differences between them. For this reason, we'll only discuss Liferay
configurations. For example, we'll look at how to configure Liferay to
work in a clustered environment, but not how to create the cluster in
your application server. The documentation for your particular
application server is always a much better place to learn those kinds of
things.

This chapter explains how to configure Liferay for a number of advanced
scenarios, such as

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Clustering
\item
  Distributed Caching
\item
  Deploying Customized versions of Liferay
\item
  Performance Testing and Tuning
\item
  Content Delivery Network
\end{itemize}

During the discussion, we'll mention a number of other open source
products upon which Liferay relies for much of this functionality. These
products all have their own documentation which should be consulted for
a fuller view of what these products can do. For example, Liferay uses
Ehcache for its caching mechanism. We'll cover how to configure Ehcache
to enable caches in Liferay, but will refer you to that product's
documentation for further information about that product.

Sometimes Liferay supports multiple products which perform the same
function. There are, for example, several single sign-on implementations
you can use with Liferay. We'll leave it up to you to select which
product best fits the needs of your project without recommending one
product over another.

With all of that said, let's get started configuring Liferay for the
enterprise.

\section{Liferay Clustering}\label{liferay-clustering}

Liferay Portal is designed to serve everything from the smallest to the
largest web sites. Out of the box, it's configured optimally for a
single server environment. If one server isn't sufficient to serve the
high traffic needs of your site, Liferay scales to the size you need.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/enterprise-configuration.png}
\caption{\\Figure 22.1: Liferay is designed to scale to as large an
installation as you need.}
\end{figure}

Liferay works well in clusters of multiple machines (horizontal cluster)
or in clusters of multiple VMs on a single machine (vertical cluster),
or any mixture of the two. Once you have Liferay installed in more than
one application server node, there are several optimizations that need
to be made. At a minimum, Liferay should be configured in the following
way for a clustered environment:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  All nodes should be pointing to the same Liferay database or database
  cluster.
\item
  Documents and Media repositories should be accessible to all nodes of
  the cluster.
\item
  Search should be configured for replication or should use a separate
  search server.
\item
  The cache should be replicating across all nodes of the cluster.
\item
  Hot deploy folders should be configured for each node if you're not
  using server farms.
\end{itemize}

If you haven't configured your application server to use farms for
deployment, the hot deploy folder should be a separate folder for all
the nodes, and plugins will have to be deployed to all of the nodes
individually. This can be done via a script. If you do have farms
configured, you can deploy normally to any node's deploy folder, and
your farm configuration should take care of syncing the deployment to
all nodes.

Many of these configuration changes can be made by adding or modifying
properties in your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. Remember that
this file overrides the defaults in the \texttt{portal.properties} file.
The original version of this file can be found in the Liferay source
code or can be extracted from the \texttt{portal-impl.jar} file in your
Liferay installation. You can also browse an online version of Liferay's
properties file:
\url{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html}.
It's a best practice to copy the relevant section you want to modify
from \texttt{portal.properties} into your \texttt{portal-ext.properties}
file, and then modify the values there.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} This chapter documents a Liferay-specific cluster
configuration, without getting into specific implementations of third
party software, such as Java EE application servers, HTTP servers, and
load balancers. Please consult your documentation for those components
of your cluster for specific details of those components. Before
configuring Liferay in a cluster configuration, make sure your OS is not
defining the hostname of your box to the local network at 127.0.0.1.

\end{roundedframe}
We'll discuss each of the points above one by one to present a clear
picture of how to cluster Liferay.

\subsection{All Nodes Should Point to the Same Liferay
Database}\label{all-nodes-should-point-to-the-same-liferay-database}

This is pretty self-explanatory. Each node should be configured with a
data source that points to one Liferay database (or a database cluster)
that all the nodes will share. This ensures all the nodes operate from
the same basic data set. This means, of course, Liferay cannot (and
should not) use the embedded HSQL database that is shipped with the
bundles (but you already knew that, right?). And, of course, it goes
without saying that the database server is a separate physical box from
the server which is running Liferay.

Beyond a database cluster, there are two more advanced options you can
use to optimize your database configuration: a read-writer database
configuration, and sharding.

\subsubsection{Read-Writer Database
Configuration}\label{read-writer-database-configuration}

Liferay allows you to use two different data sources for reading and
writing. This enables you to split your database infrastructure into two
sets: one that is optimized for reading and one that is optimized for
writing. Since all major databases support replication in one form or
another, you can then use your database vendor's replication mechanism
to keep the databases in sync in a much faster manner than if you had a
single data source which handled everything.

Enabling a read-writer database is simple. In your
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file, configure two different data
sources for Liferay to use, one for reading, and one for writing:

\begin{verbatim}
jdbc.read.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
jdbc.read.url=jdbc:mysql://dbread.com/lportal?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8 \ 
&useFastDateParsing=false
jdbc.read.username=**your user name**
jdbc.read.password=**your password**
jdbc.write.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
jdbc.write.url=jdbc:mysql://dbwrite.com/lportal?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8 \ 
&useFastDateParsing=false
jdbc.write.username=**your user name**
jdbc.write.password=**your password**
\end{verbatim}

Of course, specify the user name and password to your database in the
above configuration.

After this, enable the read-writer database configuration by
uncommenting the Spring configuration file which enables it in your
\texttt{spring.configs} property (line to uncomment is in bold):

\begin{verbatim}
spring.configs=\
META-INF/base-spring.xml,\
META-INF/hibernate-spring.xml,\
META-INF/infrastructure-spring.xml,\
META-INF/management-spring.xml,\
META-INF/util-spring.xml,\
META-INF/editor-spring.xml,\
META-INF/jcr-spring.xml,\
META-INF/messaging-spring.xml,\
META-INF/scheduler-spring.xml,\
META-INF/search-spring.xml,\
META-INF/counter-spring.xml,\
META-INF/document-library-spring.xml,\
META-INF/lock-spring.xml,\
META-INF/mail-spring.xml,\
META-INF/portal-spring.xml,\
META-INF/portlet-container-spring.xml,\
META-INF/wsrp-spring.xml,\
META-INF/mirage-spring.xml,\
**META-INF/dynamic-data-source-spring.xml,\**
#META-INF/shard-data-source-spring.xml,\
META-INF/ext-spring.xml
\end{verbatim}

The next time you restart Liferay, it will now use the two data sources
you have defined. Be sure you have correctly set up your two databases
for replication before starting Liferay.

Next, we'll look at database sharding.

\subsubsection{Database Sharding}\label{database-sharding}

Liferay, starting with version 5.2.3, supports database sharding for
different portal instances. Sharding is a term used to describe an
extremely high scalability configuration for systems with massive
amounts of users. In diagrams, a database is normally pictured as a
cylinder. Instead, picture it as a glass bottle full of data. Now take
that bottle and smash it onto a concrete sidewalk. There will be shards
of glass everywhere. If that bottle were a database, each shard now is a
database, with a subset of the data in each shard.

This allows you to split up your database by various types of data that
might be in it. For example, some implementations of sharding a database
split up the users: those with last names beginning with A to D go in
one database; E to I go in another; etc. When users log in, they are
directed to the instance of the application that is connected to the
database that corresponds to their last names. In this manner,
processing is split up evenly, and the amount of data the application
needs to sort through is reduced.

By default, Liferay allows you to support sharding through different
portal instances, using the \emph{round robin shard selector}. This is a
class which serves as the default algorithm for sharding in Liferay.
Using this algorithm, Liferay selects from several different portal
instances and evenly distributes the data across them. Alternatively,
you can use the manual shard selector. In this case, you'd need to use
the UI provided in the Control Panel to configure your shards.

Of course, if you wish to have your developers implement your own
sharding algorithm, you can do that. This is a great use of the Ext
plugin. You can select which algorithm is active via the
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
shard.selector=com.liferay.portal.dao.shard.RoundRobinShardSelector
#shard.selector=com.liferay.portal.dao.shard.ManualShardSelector
#shard.selector=[your implementation here]
\end{verbatim}

Enabling sharding is easy. You'll need to make sure you are using
Liferay's data source implementation instead of your application
server's. Set your various database shards in your
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file this way:

\begin{verbatim}
jdbc.default.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver

Once you do this, you can set up your DNS so several domain names point
to your Liferay installation (e.g., abc1.com, abc2.com, abc3.com). Next,
go to the Control Panel and click on \emph{Portal Instances} under the
Configuration heading. Create two to three instances bound to the DNS
names you have configured.

If you're using the \texttt{RoundRobinShardSelector} class, Liferay automatically
enters data into each instance one by one. If you're using the
\texttt{ManualShardSelector} class, you'll have to specify a shard for
each instance using the UI.

\caption{\\Figure 22.2: When creating a shard using the manual shard
selector, specify the shard you want to use for that instance.}
\end{figure}

The last thing you need to do is modify the \texttt{spring.configs}
section of your \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file to enable the
sharding configuration, which by default is commented out. To do this,
your \texttt{spring.configs} should look like this (modified section is
in bold):

\begin{verbatim}
spring.configs=\
    META-INF/base-spring.xml,\
    \
    META-INF/hibernate-spring.xml,\

\end{verbatim}

That's all there is to it. Your system is now set up for sharding. Now
that you've got your database set up and optimized for a large
installation, let's turn to clustering the Documents and Media Library.

\subsection{Documents and Media Library
Clustering}\label{documents-and-media-library-clustering}

Beginning with Liferay 6.1, Liferay's Documents and Media Library is
capable of mounting several repositories at a time while presenting a
unified interface to the user. By default, users can use the Liferay
repository, which is already mounted. This repository is built into
Liferay Portal and can use one of several different store
implementations as its back-end. In addition to this, many different
kinds of third party repositories can be mounted. If you have a separate
repository you've mounted, all nodes of the cluster will point to this
repository. Your avenue for improving performance at this point is to
cluster your third party repository, using the documentation for the
repository you have chosen. If you don't have a third party repository,
you can configure the Liferay repository to perform well in a clustered
configuration.

The main thing to keep in mind is you need to make sure that every node
of the cluster has the same access to the file store as every other
node. For this reason, you'll need to take a look at your store
configuration.

There are several options available for configuring how Liferay's
Documents and Media library stores files. Each option is a \emph{store}
which can be configured through the \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file
by setting the \texttt{dl.store.impl=} property. Let's consider the
ramifications of the various store options.

\subsubsection{Using the File System
Store}\label{using-the-file-system-store}

This is the default store. It's a simple file storage implementation
that uses a local folder to store files. You can use the file system for
your clustered configuration, but you'd have to make sure the folder to
which you point the store can handle things like concurrent requests and
file locking. For this reason, you need to use a Storage Area Network or
a clustered file system.

The file system store was the first store created for Liferay and is
heavily bound to the Liferay database. By default, documents are stored
in a \texttt{document\_library} subfolder of the \texttt{data} folder in
a Liferay bundle. Of course, you can change this path to anything you
want by using the \texttt{dl.store.file.system.root.dir=} property.

This store creates a folder structure based on primary keys in the
Liferay database. If, for example, you upload a presentation with the
file name \texttt{workflow.odp} into a folder called \emph{stuff}, the
file system store creates a folder structure which looks like the figure
below.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/enterprise-file-system-store.png}
\caption{\\Figure 22.3: Liferay's file system store creates a folder
structure based on primary keys in Liferay's database.}
\end{figure}

The actual folder path that is used by Liferay for storing documents is
this:

\begin{verbatim}
/companyId/folderId/numericFileEntryName/versionNumber
\end{verbatim}

The first folder name is the company ID to which the site belongs. The
second folder name is the ID of the Documents and Media folder within
which the document resides. The third folder name is the numeric file
entry name of the document itself. Finally, the fourth name is a version
number which is used for storing multiple versions of the document.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} The numeric file entry name of a document is distinct
from the document ID; be careful not to confuse the two! Each has an
independent counter. The numeric file entry name of a document is used
in the folder path for storing the document but the document ID is not.
The numeric file entry name of document can be found in the
\texttt{name} column of the \texttt{DLFileEntry} table in Liferay's
database; the document ID can be found in the \texttt{fileEntryId}
column of the same table.

\end{roundedframe}
As you can see, the File System Store binds your documents very closely
to Liferay, and may not be exactly what you want. But if you've been
using the default settings for a while and need to migrate your
documents, Liferay provides a migration utility in the Control Panel in
\emph{Server Administration} $\rightarrow$\emph{Data Migration}. Using this
utility, you can move your documents very easily from one store
implementation to another.

Speaking of other store implementations, let's look at some others
Liferay provides.

\subsubsection{Using the Advanced File System
Store}\label{using-the-advanced-file-system-store}

Liferay's advanced file system store is similar to the default file
system store. Like that store, it saves files to the local file
system--which, of course, could be a remote file system mount. It uses a
slightly different folder structure to store files, which is pictured
below.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in]{../../images/enterprise-adv-file-system-store.png}
\caption{\\Figure 22.4: The advanced file system store creates a more
nested folder structure than the file system store.}
\end{figure}

So what makes the advanced file system store \emph{advanced}? Several
operating systems have limitations on the number of files which can be
stored in a particular folder. The advanced file system store overcomes
this limitation by programmatically creating a structure that can expand
to millions of files, by alphabetically nesting the files in folders.
This not only allows for more files to be stored, but also improves
performance as there are less files stored per folder.

The same rules apply to the advanced file system store as apply to the
default file system store. To cluster this, you'll need to point the
store to a network mounted file system that all the nodes can access,
and that networked file system needs to support concurrent requests and
file locking. Otherwise, you may experience data corruption issues if
two users attempt to write to the same file at the same time from two
different nodes.

You may decide the advanced file system store for whatever reason
doesn't serve your needs. If this is the case, you can of course mount
other file systems into the documents and media library. In addition to
this, you can also redefine the Liferay store to use one of three other
supported protocols. We'll look at these next.

\subsubsection{Using the CMIS Store}\label{using-the-cmis-store}

Though you can mount as many different CMIS (Content Management
Interoperability Services) repositories as you like in the Documents and
Media library, you may wish also to redefine the Liferay repository to
point to a CMIS repository as well. Why? Users might want to create a
folder or upload content to the Liferay repository. It would be nice if
that Liferay repository was connected to a clustered CMIS repository by
the administrator without having to mount it through the UI. The CMIS
store allows you to do just that.

If you wish to use the CMIS store, all you need to do is set the
following four directives in your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
dl.store.cmis.credentials.username=yourusername
dl.store.cmis.credentials.password=yourpassword
dl.store.cmis.repository.url=http://localhost:8080/url/to/your/cmis/repository
dl.store.cmis.system.root.dir=Liferay Home
\end{verbatim}

With the configuration above, the Liferay repository is connected to
CMIS via the CMIS store. As long as all nodes are pointing to your CMIS
repository, everything in your Liferay cluster should be fine, as the
CMIS protocol prevents multiple simultaneous file access from causing
data corruption.

From here, we'll move on to the JCR store.

\subsubsection{Using the JCR Store}\label{using-the-jcr-store}

Liferay Portal supports as a store the Java Content Repository standard.
Under the hood, Liferay uses Jackrabbit, a project from Apache, as its
JSR-170 compliant document repository. By default, Jackrabbit is
configured to store the documents on the local file system upon which
Liferay is installed, in the
\texttt{{[}Liferay Home{]}/liferay/jackrabbit} folder. Inside this
folder is Jackrabbit's configuration file, called
\texttt{repository.xml}.

Using the default settings, the JCR store is not very different from the
file system stores, except you can use any JCR client to access the
files. You can, however, modify Jackrabbit's configuration so it stores
files in a database that can be accessed by all nodes, and so that it
operates as a cluster within Liferay's cluster.

To move the default repository location to a shared folder, you do not
need to edit Jackrabbit's configuration file. Instead, find the section
in \texttt{portal.properties} labeled \textbf{JCR} and copy/paste that
section into your \texttt{portal-ext.properties} file. One of the
properties, by default, is the following:

\begin{verbatim}
jcr.jackrabbit.repository.root=${liferay.home}/data/jackrabbit
\end{verbatim}

Change this property to point to a shared folder that all the nodes can
see. A new Jackrabbit configuration file is then generated in that
location, and you'll have to edit that file to modify Jackrabbit's
configuration.

Note that because of file locking issues, this isn't the best way to
share Jackrabbit resources, unless you're using a networked file system
that can handle concurrency and file locking. If you have two people
logged in at the same time uploading content, you could encounter data
corruption using this method, and because of this, we don't recommend it
for a production system. Instead, if you want to use the Java Content
Repository in a cluster, you should redirect Jackrabbit into your
database of choice. You can use the Liferay database or another database
for this purpose. This requires editing Jackrabbit's configuration file.

The default Jackrabbit configuration file has sections commented out for
moving the Jackrabbit configuration into the database. This has been
done to make it as easy as possible to enable this configuration. To
move the Jackrabbit configuration into the database, simply comment out
the sections relating to the file system and comment in the sections
relating to the database. These by default are configured for a MySQL
database. If you are using another database, you will likely need to
modify the configuration, as there are changes to the configuration file
that are necessary for specific databases. For example, the default
configuration uses Jackrabbit's \texttt{DbFileSystem} class to mimic a
file system in the database. While this works well in MySQL, it doesn't
work for all databases. For example, if you're using an Oracle database,
you'll need to modify this to use \texttt{Or\-a\-cle\-Fi\-le\-Sys\-tem}.

Modify the JDBC database URLs so they point to your database. This, of
course, must be done on all nodes of the cluster. Don't forget to create
the database first, and grant the user ID you are specifying in the
configuration file access to create, modify, and drop tables. After
this, be sure to uncomment the
\texttt{\textless{}Cluster/\textgreater{}} section at the bottom of the
file. For further information, it's best to check out the Jackrabbit
documentation. Please see the Jackrabbit documentation at
\texttt{http://jackrabbit.apache.org} for further information.

Once you've configured Jackrabbit to store its repository in a database,
the next time you bring up Liferay, the necessary database tables are
created automatically. Jackrabbit, however, does not create indexes on
these tables, and so over time this can be a performance penalty. To fix
this, you'll need to manually go into your database and index the
primary key columns for all the Jackrabbit tables.

Note that this configuration doesn't perform as well as the advanced
file system store, because you're storing documents in a database
instead of on the file system. But it does have the benefit of
clustering well. Next, we'll look at Amazon's S3 store.

\paragraph{Using Amazon Simple Storage
Service}\label{using-amazon-simple-storage-service}

Amazon's simple storage service (S3) is a cloud-based storage solution
which you can use with Liferay. All you need is an account, and you can
store your documents to the cloud from all nodes, seamlessly.

This is easy to set up. When you sign up for the service, Amazon assigns
you some unique keys which link you to your account. In Amazon's
interface, you can create ``buckets'' of data optimized by region. Once
you've created these to your specifications, all you need to do is
declare them in \texttt{portal-ext.properties}:

\begin{verbatim}
dl.store.s3.access.key=
dl.store.s3.secret.key=
dl.store.s3.bucket.name=
\end{verbatim}

Once you have these configured, set your store implementation to the
\texttt{S3Store}:

\begin{verbatim}
dl.store.impl=com.liferay.portlet.documentlibrary.store.S3Store
\end{verbatim}

Consult the Amazon Simple Storage documentation for additional details
on using Amazon's service.

We have one more store to go over: the Documentum store.

\paragraph{Using the Documentum Store}\label{using-the-documentum-store}

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{.25\textwidth}
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/ee-feature-web.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

If you have a Liferay Portal EE license, you have access to the
Documentum hook which adds support for Documentum to Liferay's Documents
and Media library. The Documentum hook is included in the Documentum
Connector EE app which you can download and install from Liferay
Marketplace.

This hook doesn't add an option to make the Liferay repository into a
Documentum repository, as the other store implementations do. Instead,
it gives you the ability to mount Documentum repositories via the
Documents and Media library UI.

There's not really a lot to this; it's incredibly easy. Click \emph{Add}
$\rightarrow$\emph{Repository}, and in the form that appears, choose
\emph{Documentum} as the repository type. After that, enter a name for
the repository, specify the location of the Documentum repository and
cabinet, and Liferay mounts the repository for you. That's really all
there is to it. If all your nodes are pointing to a Documentum
repository, you can cluster Documentum to achieve higher performance.

Now that we've covered the available ways you can configure Documents
and Media for clustering, let's move on to configuring search.

\subsection{Clustering Search}\label{clustering-search}

You can configure search for clustering in one of two ways: you can use
pluggable enterprise search (recommended) or you can configure Lucene so
indexes replicate across the individual file systems of the nodes in the
cluster. We'll look at both ways to do this.

\subsubsection{Using Pluggable Enterprise
Search}\label{using-pluggable-enterprise-search}

As an alternative to using Lucene, Liferay supports pluggable search
engines. The first implementation of this uses the open source search
engine \emph{Solr}, but in the future there will be many such plugins
for your search engine of choice. This allows you to use a completely
separate product for search, and this product can be installed on
another application server or cluster of servers. Your search engine
then operates completely independently of your Liferay Portal nodes in a
clustered environment, acting as a search service for all the nodes
simultaneously.

This makes it much easier to deal with search indexes. You no longer
have to maintain indexes on every node in your cluster, and you get to
offload indexing activity to a separate server, so your nodes can
concentrate their CPU power on serving pages. Each Liferay node sends
requests to the search engine to update the search index when needed,
and these updates are then queued and handled automatically by the
search engine, independently. It's kind of like having an army of robots
ready and willing to do your bidding.

First, you'll need to configure your Solr server, and then you need to
install Liferay's Solr plugin to redirect searches over to it.

\paragraph{Configuring the Solr Search
Server}\label{configuring-the-solr-search-server}

Since Solr is a standalone search engine, you'll need to download it and
install it first according to the instructions on the Solr web site
\footnote{\url{http://lucene.apache.org/solr}}. Of course, it's best to use a
server that is separate from your Liferay installation, as your Solr
server becomes responsible for all indexing and searching for your
entire cluster. You definitely don't want both Solr and Liferay on the
same box. Solr is distributed as a \texttt{.war} file with several
\texttt{.jar} files which need to be available on your application
server's classpath. Once you have Solr up and running, integrating it
with Liferay is easy, but it requires a restart of your application
server.

The first thing you need to define on the Solr box is the location of
your search index. Assuming you're running a Linux server and you've
mounted a file system for the index at \texttt{/solr}, create an
environment variable that points to this folder. This environment
variable needs to be called \texttt{\$SOLR\_HOME}. So for our example,
we would define:

\begin{verbatim}
$SOLR_HOME=/solr
\end{verbatim}

This environment variable can be defined anywhere you need: in your
operating system's start up sequence, in the environment for the user
who is logged in, or in the start up script for your application server.
If you're using Tomcat to host Solr, modify \texttt{setenv.sh} or
\texttt{setenv.bat} and add the environment variable there.

Once you've created the environment variable, you then can use it in
your application server's start up configuration as a parameter to your
JVM. This is configured differently per application server, but again,
if you're using Tomcat, edit \texttt{catalina.sh} or
\texttt{catalina.bat} and append the following to the
\texttt{\$JAVA\_OPTS} variable:

\begin{verbatim}
-Dsolr.solr.home=$SOLR_HOME
\end{verbatim}

This takes care of telling Solr where to store its search index. After
you have Solr installed and the configuration finished, shut it down, as
there is some more configuration to do.

\paragraph{Installing the Solr Liferay
Plugin}\label{installing-the-solr-liferay-plugin}

Next, you have a choice. If you have installed Solr on the same system
upon which Liferay is running (not recommended), you can simply go to
the Liferay Marketplace and install the \emph{solr-web} plugin. This,
however, defeats much of the purpose of using Solr, because the goal is
to offload search indexing to another box to free up processing for your
installation of Liferay. For this reason, you really shouldn't run
Liferay and your search engine on the same box. Unfortunately, the
configuration in the plugin is set exactly that way, presumably to allow
you to experiment with different search configurations. To run them
separately--as you would in a production environment--, you'll have to
make a change to a configuration file in the plugin before you install
it so you can tell Liferay where to send indexing requests. In this
case, go to the Liferay Marketplace and download the plugin to your
system.

Open or extract the plugin. Inside the plugin, you'll find a file called
\texttt{solr-spring.xml} in the \texttt{WEB-INF/classes/META-INF}
folder. Open this file in a text editor and you will see the entry which
defines where the Solr server can be found by Liferay:

\begin{verbatim}
<bean class="com.liferay.portal.spring.context.PortletBeanFactoryPostProcessor" />

<!-- Solr search engine -->

<bean id="com.liferay.portal.search.solr.server.BasicAuthSolrServer" 
    class="com.liferay.portal.search.solr.server.BasicAuthSolrServer">
    <constructor-arg type="java.lang.String" value="http://localhost:8080/solr" />
         </bean>
\end{verbatim}

Modify this value so it points to the server where Solr is running. Then
save the file and put it back into the plugin archive in the same place
it was before.

Next, extract the file \texttt{schema.xml} from the plugin. It should be
in the \texttt{doc\-root\-/WEB\-INF\-/conf} folder. This file tells Solr how to
index the data coming from Liferay, and can be customized for your
installation. Copy this file to \texttt{\$SOLR\_HOME/conf} on your Solr
box (you may have to create the \texttt{conf} directory).

Before you start Solr, you should provide Solr with a list of
\textbf{synonyms} and \textbf{stop words}. Synonyms are words that
should be equivalent in search. For example, if a user searches for
\emph{important information}, you may want to show results for
\emph{required} \emph{information} or \emph{critical information}. You
can define these in \texttt{synonyms.txt}. Stop words are defined in
\texttt{stop\-words.txt} and are words that should not be indexed:
articles, pronouns, and other words that have little value in a search.
Place these files in your \texttt{\$SOLR\_HOME/conf} folder. Examples
for both of these files are found in the Solr archive in the
\texttt{solr-4.1.0/ex\-am\-ple\-/solr\-/col\-lec\-tion1/conf} folder. Additional
Solr configuration options, most importantly \texttt{sol\-r\-con\-fig.xml} and
\texttt{el\-e\-vate.xml}, are in the \texttt{\$SOLR\_HOME/conf} folder. Now
you can start Solr. After Solr has started, hot deploy the
\texttt{solr-web} plugin to all your nodes. See the next section for
instructions on hot deploying to a cluster.

Once the plugin is hot deployed, your Liferay server's search is
automatically upgraded to use Solr. It's likely, however, that initial
searches will come up with nothing: this is because you need to reindex
everything using Solr.

Navigate to the Control Panel. Under the Configuration heading, click on
\emph{Server Administration}. On the Resources tab, click the
\emph{Execute} button next to \emph{Reindex all search indexes}. When
you click this button, Liferay begins sending indexing requests to Solr
for execution. Once Solr has indexed all your data, you'll have a search
server running independently of all your Liferay nodes.

Installing the plugin to your nodes has the effect of overriding any
calls to Lucene for searching. All Liferay's search boxes will now use
Solr as the search index. This is ideal for a clustered environment, as
it allows all your nodes to share one search server and one search
index, and this search server operates independently of all your nodes.
If, however, you don't have the server hardware upon which to install a
separate search server, you can sync the search indexes between all your
nodes, as is described next.

\subsubsection{Clustering Lucene Indexes on All
Nodes}\label{clustering-lucene-indexes-on-all-nodes}

Lucene, the search indexer which Liferay uses, can be configured to sync
indexes across each cluster node. This is the easiest configuration to
implement, though of course, it's not as ``clean'' a configuration as
using pluggable enterprise search. Sometimes, however, you just don't
have another server to use for search indexing, so you need a way to
keep all your nodes in sync. By default, Liferay provides a method
called Cluster Link which can send indexing requests to all nodes in the
cluster to keep them in sync. This configuration doesn't require any
additional hardware, and it performs very well. It may increase network
traffic when an individual server reboots, since a full reindex will be
needed. But this should rarely happen, making it a good tradeoff if you
don't have the extra hardware to implement a Solr search server.

You can enable Cluster Link by setting the following property in your
\texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file:

\begin{verbatim}
cluster.link.enabled=true
\end{verbatim}

To cluster your search indexes, you also need to set the following
property:

\begin{verbatim}
lucene.replicate.write=true
\end{verbatim}

If you have \texttt{cluster.link.enabled=true} but
\texttt{lucene.replicate.write=false}, you'll enable cache replication
but not index replication.

Of course, \texttt{cluster.link.enabled=true} and
\texttt{lucene.replicate.write=true} need to be set on all your nodes.
That's all you need to do to sync your indexes. Pretty easy, right? Of
course, if you have existing indexes, you'll want to reindex as
described in the previous section once you have Cluster Link enabled on
all your nodes.

\subsection{Distributed Caching}\label{distributed-caching}

Enabling Cluster Link automatically activates distributed caching.
Distributed caching enables some RMI (Remote Method Invocation) cache
listeners that are designed to replicate the cache across a cluster.

Liferay uses \href{www.ehcache.org}{Ehcache}, which has robust
distributed caching support. This means that the cache can be
distributed across multiple Liferay nodes running concurrently. Enabling
this cache can increase performance dramatically. For example, suppose
that two users are browsing the message boards. The first user clicks a
thread to read it. Liferay must look up that thread from the database
and format it for display in the browser. With a distributed Ehcache
running, this thread is stored in a cache for quick retrieval, and that
cache is then replicated to the other nodes in the cluster. Suppose then
that the second user who is being served by another node in the cluster
wants to read the same forum thread and clicks on it. This time, the
data is retrieved more quickly. Because the thread is in the cache, no
trip to the database is necessary.

This is much more powerful than having a cache running separately on
each node. The power of \emph{distributed} caching allows for common
portal destinations to be cached for multiple users. The first user can
post a message to the thread he or she was reading, and the cache is
updated across all the nodes, making the new post available immediately
from the local cache. Without that, the second user would need to wait
until the cache was invalidated on the node he or she connected to
before he or she could see the updated forum post.

Once you enable distributed caching, of course, you should do some due
diligence and test your system under a load that best simulates the kind
of traffic your system needs to handle. If you'll be serving up a lot of
message board messages, your script should reflect that. If web content
is the core of your site, your script should reflect that too.

As a result of a load test, you may find that the default distributed
cache settings aren't optimized for your site. In this case, you'll need
to tweak the settings yourself. You can modify the Liferay installation
directly or you can use a plugin to do it. Either way, the settings you
change are the same. Next, we'll discuss a special EE-only optimization
that can be made to the cache. After that, we'll explain how to
configure Liferay's caching settings.

By default, Liferay's distributed cache uses the RMI replication
mechanism, which uses a point to point communication topology. As you
can guess, this kind of structure doesn't scale well for a large cluster
with many nodes. Because each node has to send the same event to other
nodes \texttt{N - 1} times, network traffic becomes a bottleneck when
\texttt{N} is too large. Ehcache also has a performance issue of its
own, in that it creates a replication thread for each cache entity. In a
large system like Liferay Portal, it's very common to have more than 100
cached entities. This translates to 100+ cache replication threads.
Threads are expensive, because they take resources (memory and CPU
power). Most of the time, these threads are sleeping, because they only
need to work when a cached entity has to talk to remote peers.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/19-ehcache-inefficient-algorithm.png}
\caption{\\Figure 22.5: The default algorithm requires each node to create
massive amounts of dispatch threads to update the cache for each node in
the cluster.}
\end{figure}

Putting heap memory aside (because the amount of memory on the heap
depends on the application(s) running), consider the stack memory
footprint of those 100+ threads. By default on most platforms, the
thread stack size is 2 MB; for 100 threads, that's more than 200 MB. If
you include the heap memory size, this number can become as high as 500
MB for just one node. And that massive amount of threads can also cause
frequent context switch overhead, which translates to increased CPU
cycles.

For large installations containing many nodes, Liferay has developed an
enhanced algorithm for handling cache replication that can can fix both
the \texttt{1} to \texttt{N - 1} network communication bottleneck, as
well as the massive threads bottleneck. The default implementation uses
JGroups' UDP multicast to communicate.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/19-ehcache-efficient-algorithm.png}
\caption{\\Figure 22.6: Liferay's algorithm uses a single UDP multicast
channel, so that nodes don't have to create a thread for each other node
in the cluster.}
\end{figure}

To reduce the number of replication threads, we provide a small pool of
dispatching threads. These deliver cache cluster events to remote peers.
Since all cache entities' cluster events must go through our pool of
dispatching threads to communicate, this gives us a chance to coalesce
events: if two modifications to the same cache object happen at almost
the same time, we can combine the changes into one, and then we only
need to notify remote peers once. This reduces traffic on the network.
We should also note that newer versions of Ehcache support the JGroups
replicator and can also fix the \texttt{1} to \texttt{N - 1} network
communication; however, they cannot fix the massive threads issue and
they cannot coalesce cache events.

For EE customers who are interested in this feature, all you have to do
to enable the enhanced algorithm is to install a plugin from the Liferay
Marketplace and set the following property in the
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} files of each of your nodes:

\begin{verbatim}
ehcache.cluster.link.replication.enabled=true
\end{verbatim}

Search Liferay Marketplace for the \emph{Ehcache Cluster EE} plugin,
which is free to all EE customers, and install it on each of your nodes.
The new algorithm is immediately activated and you can reap the benefits
right away.

Next, let's discuss how to modify your Ehache settings. As we've seen,
it's easy to use the default Ehcache settings just by enabling Cluster
Link. If you need to tweak the cache for your site, you have two
options: you can modify Ehcache settings with a plugin or you can modify
them directly.

\subsubsection{Modifying the Ehcache Settings With a
Plugin}\label{modifying-the-ehcache-settings-with-a-plugin}

A benefit of working with plugins is that you can quickly install a
plugin on each node of your cluster without taking down the cluster.
Modifying the Ehcache settings with a plugin is recommended over
modifying Liferay's Ehcache settings directly. We'll discuss this method
first. If you're not a developer, don't worry--even though you'll create
a plugin, you won't have to write any code.

Since we're assuming you're an administrator and not a developer, we'll
take the easiest route, and use Liferay's graphical development tools,
rather than the command line Plugins SDK by itself. If you're a Liferay
EE customer, download Liferay Developer Studio from the Customer Portal.
Set it up with all the defaults from the first start wizard, and you're
good to go (skip the next paragraph).

If you're not a Liferay EE customer, download Eclipse and install
Liferay IDE from the Eclipse Marketplace. Download the Plugins SDK for
your edition of Liferay from either the Customer Portal (EE) or the
Downloads page on liferay.com. Connect Liferay IDE to your Plugins SDK
using the instructions found in the \emph{Liferay Developer Network}.\footnote{\url{https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/liferay-ide}}

Next, create a hook plugin by selecting \emph{File} $\rightarrow$\emph{New} →
\emph{Liferay Project}. Select \emph{Hook} as the project type and give
your project a name. Click \emph{Finish} and your project is created.

In your project, create a text file called \texttt{port\-let.pro\-per\-ties}
in the \texttt{doc\-root\-/WEB\-INF\-/src} folder. This file can override
properties in your portal just like \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties}. Into
this file, add the following three properties:

\begin{verbatim}
net.sf.ehcache.configurationResourceName=
ehcache.single.vm.config.location= 
ehcache.multi.vm.config.location=
\end{verbatim}

Liferay's configuration files are, of course, used by default. If you're
overriding these properties, it's because you want to customize the
configuration for your own site. A good way to start with this is to
extract Liferay's configuration files and then customize them. If you're
running an application server (such as Tomcat) that allows you to browse
to the running instance of Liferay, you can extract Liferay's
configuration files from Liferay itself. If you're not, you can extract
them from Liferay's \texttt{.war} file or Liferay's source code. In
either place, you'll find the files in the \texttt{portal-impl.jar}
file, which is in Liferay's \texttt{WEB-INF/lib} folder. The files you
want are \texttt{hi\-ber\-nate-clus\-tered.xml},
\texttt{life\-ray-sin\-gle-vm.xml}, and
\texttt{life\-ray-mul\-ti-vm-clus\-tered.xml}, and they'll be in the
\texttt{/eh\-cache} folder in this \texttt{.jar}. Once you have these,
make a subfolder of the \texttt{docroot} folder in your project. Place
the files you extracted into this folder and then specify this folder in
the properties above.

For example, if you created a folder called \texttt{custom\_cache} in
your project's \texttt{doc\-root} folder, you'd copy the three XML
configuration files (\texttt{hib\-er\-nate-clus\-tered.xml},
\texttt{life\-ray-sin\-gle-vm.xml}, and
\texttt{life\-ray-mul\-ti-vm-clus\-tered.xml}) there. Then you'd edit your
\texttt{port\-let.pro\-per\-ties} and specify your configuration files in the
three properties above:

\begin{verbatim}
net.sf.ehcache.configurationResourceName=/custom\_cache/hibernate-clustered.xml
ehcache.single.vm.config.location=/custom\_cache/liferay-single-vm.xml
ehcache.multi.vm.config.location=/custom\_cache/liferay-multi-vm-clustered.xml
\end{verbatim}

Save the file and deploy the plugin (deploying plugins is covered on the
\href{https://dev.liferay.com/development}{Liferay
Developer Network}), and the settings you've placed in those files will
override the default Liferay settings. In this way, you can tweak your
cache settings so that your cache performs optimally for the type of
traffic generated by your site. The strength of doing it this way is
that you don't have restart your server to change the cache settings.
This is a great benefit, but beware: since Ehcache doesn't allow for
changes to cache settings while the cache is alive, reconfiguring a
cache while the server is running will flush the cache.

There is, of course, another way to do this if you don't want to create
a plugin. It requires you to restart the server to enable the new cache
settings, but you don't have to work with any developer tools to do it.

\subsubsection{Modifying the Ehcache Settings Directly}\label{modifying-the-ehcache-settings-directly}

This method is pretty similar to the plugin method, except that you have
to modify the Liferay installation directly. You'll still need to
extract Liferay's configuration files as described in the previous
section. Next, shut down your server and find the location in the server
where Liferay is installed (this may not be possible on all application
servers, and if this is the case, you'll need to use the plugin method
described above). For example, suppose you're running Liferay on Tomcat.
Tomcat stores the deployed version of Liferay in
\texttt{{[}Tomcat Home{]}/webapps/ROOT}. Inside this folder is the
folder structure \texttt{WEB-INF/classes}. You can create a new folder
in here called \texttt{custom\_cache} to store the custom versions of
the cache configuration files. Copy the files you extracted from Liferay
into this folder.

You then need to modify the properties in \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties}
that point to these files. Copy/paste the \emph{Hibernate} section of
\texttt{por\-tal.pro\-per\-ties} into your \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file
and then modify the \texttt{net.sf.eh\-cache.con\-fig\-ur\-a\-tion\-Re\-source\-Name}
property to point to the clustered version of the configuration file
that is now in your custom folder:

\begin{verbatim}
net.sf.ehcache.configurationResourceName=/custom_cache/hibernate-clustered.xml
\end{verbatim}

Now that Liferay is pointing to your custom file, you can modify the
settings in this file to change the cache configuration for Hibernate.

Next, copy/paste the \emph{Ehcache} section from the
\texttt{por\-tal.pro\-per\-ties} file into your \texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties}
file. Modify the properties so they point to the files in your custom
folder. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
ehcache.multi.vm.config.location=/custom_cache/liferay-multi-vm-clustered.xml
\end{verbatim}

You can now take a look at the settings in these files and tune them to
fit your environment and application. Let's examine how to do that next.

\subsubsection{Customizing Hibernate Cache
Settings}\label{customizing-hibernate-cache-settings}

By default, Hibernate (Liferay's database persistence layer) is
configured to use Ehcache as its cache provider. This is the recommended
setting. If you're using the default settings using Cluster Link, you
already have this enabled. If, however, you need to customize the
settings, you'll have to customize it in one of the ways described
above: either in a plugin or in the deployed instance of Liferay. The
first thing, of course, is to start off with the clustered version of
the file. Copy the \texttt{hibernate-clustered.xml} configuration file
to your plugin or to a place in Liferay's classpath (as described above)
where you can refer to it. Then change the following property to point
to the file:

\begin{verbatim}
net.sf.ehcache.configurationResourceName=/path/to/hibernate-clustered.xml
\end{verbatim}

Next, open this file in a text editor. You'll notice that the
configuration is already set up to perform distributed caching through a
multi-cast connection. The configuration, however, might not be set up
optimally for your particular application. Notice that by default, the
only object cached in the Hibernate cache is the User object
(\texttt{com.life\-ray.por\-tal.mo\-del.im\-pl.U\-ser\-Impl}). This means that
when a user logs in, his or her User object will go in the cache so that
any portal operation that requires access to it (such as permission
checking) can retrieve that object very quickly from the cache.

You may wish to add other objects to the cache. For example, a large
part of your application may be document management using the Documents
and Media portlet. In this case, you may want to cache media objects,
such as \texttt{DLFileEntryImpl} to improve performance as users access
documents. To do that, add another block to the configuration file with
the class you want to cache:

Your site may use the message boards portlet, and those message boards
may get a lot of traffic. To cache the threads on the message boards,
configure a block with the \texttt{MBMessageImpl} class:

\begin{verbatim}
<cache eternal=``false'' maxElementsInMemory=``10000''
    name=``com.liferay.portlet.messageboards.model.impl.MBMessageImpl''
    overflowToDisk=``false'' timeToIdleSeconds=``600''> 
\end{verbatim}


Note that if your developers have overridden any of these classes in an
Ext plugin, you'll have to specify the overridden versions rather than
the stock ones that come with Liferay Portal. You can customize the
other ehcache configuration files in exactly the same way. Refer to
Ehcache's \href{http://www.ehcache.org/documentation}{documentation} for
information on how to do this.

As you can see, it's easy to add specific data to be cached. Be careful,
however, as too much caching can actually reduce performance if the JVM
runs out of memory and starts garbage collecting too frequently. You'll
likely need to experiment with the memory settings on your JVM as well
as the cache settings above. You can find the specifics about these
settings in the documentation for Ehcache.

\subsubsection{Configuring Liferay's Caching
Settings}\label{configuring-liferays-caching-settings}

To understand how Liferay behaves with various cache configurations,
let's consider five different scenarios.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Scenario 1: The portal administrator does not override the default
  cache configuration files (i.e., does not override
  \texttt{eh\-cache\-.sin\-gle\-.vm\-.con\-fig\-.lo\-ca\-tion},
  \texttt{eh\-cache\-.mul\-ti\-.vm\-.con\-fig\-.lo\-ca\-tion}, or
  \texttt{net\-.sf\-.eh\-cache\-.con\-fig\-ur\-a\-tion\-Re\-source\-Name}) but does set
  \texttt{clus\-ter\-.link\-.en\-a\-bled=true} and
  \texttt{eh\-cache\-.clus\-ter\-.link\-.rep\-li\-ca\-tion\-.en\-a\-bled=true}. This is the
  recommended configuration for a Liferay cluster, as long as the
  Ehcache Cluster EE app, available from Liferay Marketplace, has been
  installed. \textbf{Important}: The Ehcache Cluster EE app must be
  installed or cache replication will \emph{not} work with this
  configuration. In this scenario, Liferay automatically resets cache
  peer and cache event listers and replaces them with Cluster Link based
  listeners. This basically activates Cluster Link based cache
  replication. The configured \texttt{Life\-ray\-Cache\-Man\-a\-ger\-Peer\-Pro\-vi\-der\-Fac\-to\-ry},
  \texttt{RMI\-Cache\-Man\-a\-ger\-Peer\-Lis\-ten\-er\-Fac\-to\-ry}, and
  \texttt{Life\-ray\-Cache\-Ev\-ent\-Lis\-ten\-er\-Fac\-to\-ry} classes are replaced with Cluster
  Link based implementations.
\item
  Scenario 2: The portal administrator does not override the default
  cache configuration files, does set
  \texttt{clus\-ter\-.link\-.en\-a\-bled=true}, but does not set
  \texttt{eh\-cache\-.clus\-ter\-.link\-.rep\-li\-ca\-tion\-.en\-a\-bled=true}. In this case,
  Liferay utilizes Eh\-cache's out-of-the-box replication mechanisms
  (Multicast for discovery and RMI for replication). Lots of replicator
  threads appear in the log with this configuration.
\item
  Scenario 3: The portal administrator does not override the default
  cache configuration files and does not set
  \texttt{clus\-ter\-.link\-.en\-a\-bled=true}. In this case, Liferay does not
  activate any replication and operates with the assumption that there's
  no cluster.
\item
  Scenario 4: The portal administrator overrides the default cache
  configuration files and sets \texttt{clus\-ter\-.link\-.en\-a\-bled=true} and
  \texttt{eh\-cache\-.clus\-ter\-.link\-.rep\-li\-ca\-tion\-.en\-a\-bled=true}. In this case,
  Liferay uses Cluster Link based replication for any caches configured
  with the \texttt{Life\-ray\-Cache\-Ev\-ent\-Lis\-ten\-er\-Fac\-to\-ry} clas\-ses. If the portal
  administrator configured a different \texttt{Cache\-Ev\-ent\-Lis\-ten\-er} class for a
  specific cache (e.g., JGroups), then Liferay uses that listener class.
  This a basically a hybrid mode that was useful prior to Liferay 6.1
  before Liferay supported cached object replication (and only supported
  cached event replication). This is \emph{not} a recommended
  configuration for Liferay 6.1 or later.
\item
  Scenario 5: The portal administrator overrides the default cache
  configuration files and sets \texttt{clus\-ter\-.link\-.en\-a\-bled=true} but
  does not set \texttt{eh\-cache\-.clus\-ter\-.link\-.rep\-li\-ca\-tion.en\-a\-bled=true}.
  In this case, Liferay uses the cache configurations specified in the
  custom cache configuration files. This is the recommended
  configuration when overriding the default cache configuration files.
\end{itemize}

As a general rule, we recommend that portal administrators \emph{not}
set custom cache configuration files but to set
\texttt{clus\-ter\-.link\-.en\-a\-bled=true} and
\texttt{eh\-cache\-.clus\-ter\-.link\-.rep\-li\-ca\-tion\-.en\-a\-bled=true} (i.e., we
recommend that portal administrators set up the configuration in
scenario 1). If it's necessary to tune the cache configurations, it's
better to do it via a plugin than to do it directly. We explained how to
do this in the section above called \emph{Modifying the Ehcache Settings
With a Plugin.}

Next, we'll show how to share indexes in a database. This is actually
not a recommended configuration, as it's slow (databases are always
slower than file systems), but for completeness, we'll go ahead and tell
you how to do it anyway. But you've been forewarned: it's far better to
use one of the other methods of clustering your search index.

\subsubsection{Sharing a Search Index (not recommended unless you have a
file locking-aware
SAN)}\label{sharing-a-search-index-not-recommended-unless-you-have-a-file-locking-aware-san}

If you wish to have a shared index (and we really hope you don't),
you'll need to either share the index on the file system or in the
database. This requires changing your Lucene configuration.

The Lucene configuration can be changed by modifying values in your
\texttt{por\-tal-ext\-.pro\-per\-ties} file. Open your
\texttt{por\-tal.pro\-per\-ties} file and search for the text \emph{Lucene}.
Copy that section and then paste it into your
\texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file.

If you wish to store the Lucene search index on a file system that is
shared by all of the Liferay nodes (not recommended: you've been
warned), you can modify the location of the search index by changing the
\texttt{lucene.dir} property. By default, this property points to the
\texttt{lucene} folder inside the Liferay home folder:

\begin{verbatim}
lucene.dir=${liferay.home}/data/lucene/
\end{verbatim}

Change this to the folder of your choice. You'll need to restart Liferay
for the changes to take effect. You can point all of the nodes to this
folder and they will use the same index.

Like Jackrabbit, however, this is not the best way to share the search
index, as it could result in file corruption if different nodes try
reindexing at the same time. We do not recommend this for a production
system. A better way (though still not great) is to share the index via
a database, where the database can enforce data integrity on the index.
This is very easy to do; it is a simple change to your
\texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file. Of course, we also don't recommend
this for a production system, as accessing the index from a database
will be slower than from a file system. If, however, you have no other
option and want to do this anyway, keep reading.

There is a single property called \texttt{lucene.store.type}. By default
this is set to go to the file system. You can change this so that the
index is stored in the database by making it the following:

\begin{verbatim}
lucene.store.type=jdbc
\end{verbatim}

The next time Liferay is started, new tables are created in the Liferay
database, and the index is stored there. If all the Liferay nodes point
to the same database tables, they will be able to share the index.
Again, performance on this is not very good. Your DBAs may be able to
tweak the database indexes a bit to improve performance. For better
performance, you should consider using a separate search server or
syncing the indexes on the nodes' file systems.

\begin{roundedframe}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.12\textwidth}
    \vspace{-14pt}
\scalegraphics{../../images/01-tip.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{Note:} MySQL users need to modify their JDBC connection string
for this to work. Add the following parameter to your connection string:
\vspace{14pt}
\begin{verbatim}
emulateLocators=true
\end{verbatim}

\end{roundedframe}
Alternatively, you can leave the configuration alone, and each node will
have its own index. This ensures against collisions when multiple nodes
update the index. However, the indices will quickly get out of sync
since they don't replicate. For this reason, this is not a recommended
configuration either. Again, for a better configuration, replicate the
indexes with Cluster Link or use a separate search server (see the
section on Solr above).

Now we can look at the last consideration when clustering Liferay: hot
deploy.

\subsection{Hot Deploy}\label{hot-deploy}

Plugins which are hot deployed will need to be deployed separately to
all the Liferay nodes. The best way to do this is to configure your
application server to support \emph{farms}. This is a feature that
enables you to deploy an application on one node and then it replicates
automatically to each of the other nodes. This, of course, is configured
differently for each application server, so you'll need to consult your
application server's documentation to learn how to do this. It's by far
the best way to handle hot deploy, and is the recommended configuration.
If you have this working, great! You can skip the rest of this section
completely.

If for some reason your application server doesn't support this feature
or you can't use it, you'll need to come up with a way to deploy
applications across your cluster. Each node needs to have its own hot
deploy folder. This folder needs to be writable by the user under which
Liferay is running, because plugins are moved from this folder to a
temporary folder when they are deployed. This is to prevent the system
from entering an endless loop, because the presence of a plugin in the
folder is what triggers the hot deploy process.

When you want to deploy a plugin to the entire cluster, copy that plugin
to the hot deploy folders of all of the Liferay nodes. Depending on the
number of nodes, it may be best to create a script to do this. Once the
plugin has been deployed to all of the nodes, you can then make use of
it (by adding the portlet to a page or choosing the theme as the look
and feel for a page or page hierarchy).

All of the above will get basic Liferay clustering working; however, the
configuration can be further optimized. We will see how to do this next.

\section{Performance Tuning}\label{performance-tuning}

Once you have your portal up and running, you may find a need to tune it
for performance, especially if your site winds up generating more
traffic than you'd anticipated. There are some definite steps you can
take with regard to improving Liferay's performance.

\subsection{Memory}\label{memory}

Memory is one of the first things to look at when you want to optimize
performance. If you have any disk swapping, you want to avoid it at all
costs: it has a serious impact on performance. Make sure your server has
an optimal amount of memory and your JVM is tuned to use it.

There are three basic JVM command switches that control the amount of
memory in the Java heap.

\begin{verbatim}
-Xms
-Xmx
-XX:MaxPermSize
\end{verbatim}

These three settings control the amount of memory available to the JVM
initially, the maximum amount of memory into which the JVM can grow, and
the separate area of the heap called Permanent Generation space.

The first two settings should be set to the same value. This prevents
the JVM from having to reallocate memory if the application needs more.
Setting them to the same value causes the JVM to be created up front
with the maximum amount of memory you want to give it.

\begin{verbatim}
-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
\end{verbatim}

This is perfectly reasonable for a moderately sized machine or a
developer machine. These settings give the JVM 1024MB for its regular
heap size and have a PermGen space of 256MB. If you're having
performance problems, and your profiler is showing that there's a lot of
garbage collection going on, the first thing you might want to look at
is increasing the memory available to the JVM. You'll be able to tell if
memory is a problem by running a profiler (such as Jprobe, YourKit, or
the NetBeans profiler) on the server. If you see Garbage Collection (GC)
running frequently, you definitely want to increase the amount of memory
available to the JVM.

Note that there is a law of diminishing returns on memory, especially
with 64 bit systems. These systems allow you to create very large JVMs,
but the larger the JVM, the more time it takes for garbage collection to
take place. For this reason, you probably won't want to create JVMs of
more than 2 GB in size. To take advantage of higher amounts of memory on
a single system, run multiple JVMs of Liferay instead.

Issues with PermGen space can also affect performance. PermGen space
contains long-lived classes, anonymous classes and interned Strings
(immutable String objects that are kept around for a long time to
increase String processing performance). Hibernate--which Liferay uses
extensively--has been known to make use of PermGen space. If you
increase the amount of memory available to the JVM, you may want to
increase the amount of PermGen space accordingly.

\subsection{Garbage Collection}\label{garbage-collection}

As the system runs, various Java objects are created. Some of these
objects are long-lived, and some are not. The ones that are not become
\emph{de-referenced}, which means that the JVM no longer has a link to
them because they have ceased to be useful. These may be variables that
were used for methods which have already returned their values, objects
retrieved from the database for a user that is no longer logged on, or a
host of other things. These objects sit in memory and fill up the heap
space until the JVM decides it's time to clean them up.

Normally, when garbage collection (GC) runs, it stops all processing in
the JVM while it goes through the heap looking for dead objects. Once it
finds them, it frees the memory they were taking up, and then processing
can continue. If this happens in a server environment, it can slow down
the processing of requests, as all processing comes to a halt while GC
is happening.

There are some JVM switches that you can enable which can reduce the
amount of time processing is halted while garbage collecting happens.
These can improve the performance of your Liferay installation if
applied properly. As always, you will need to use a profiler to monitor
garbage collection during a load test to tune the numbers properly for
your server hardware, operating system, and application server.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/portal-admin-ch7_html_518957a7.png}
\caption{\\Figure 22.7: Java uses generational garbage collection. If an
object survives enough garbage collection events, it's promoted to a new
memory pool. For example, an object could be promoted from the young
generation memory pool to the old generation memory pool or from the old
generation memory pool to the permanent generation memory pool.}
\end{figure}

The Java heap is divided into sections for the young generation, the old
generation, and the permanent generation. The young generation is
further divided into three sections: Eden, which is where new objects
are created, and two ``survivor spaces, which we can call the
\emph{From} and \emph{To} spaces. Garbage collection occurs in stages.
Generally, it's more frequently done in the young generation, less
frequently done in the old generation, and even less frequently done in
the permanent generation, where long-lived objects reside. When garbage
collection runs in the young generation, Eden is swept for objects which
are no longer referenced. Those that are still around are moved to the
\emph{To} survivor space, and the \emph{From} space is then swept. Any
other objects in that space which still have references to them are
moved to the \emph{To} space, and the \emph{From} space is then cleared
out altogether. After this, the \emph{From} and the \emph{To} spaces
swap roles, and processing is freed up again until the next time the JVM
determines that garbage collection needs to run.

After a predetermined number of \emph{generations} of garbage
collection, surviving objects may be moved to the old generation.
Similarly, after a predetermined number of \emph{generations} of garbage
collection in the old generation, surviving objects may be moved to the
permanent generation.

By default, the JDK uses a serial garbage collector to achieve this.
This works very well for a short-lived desktop Java application, but is
not necessarily the best performer for a long-lived, server-based
application like Liferay. For this reason, you may wish to switch to the
Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) collector.

In CMS garbage collection, rather than halting application processing
altogether, this garbage collector makes one short pause in application
execution to mark objects directly reachable from the application code.
Then it allows the application to run while it marks all objects which
are reachable from the set it marked. Finally, it adds another phase
called the \emph{remark} phase which finalizes marking by revisiting any
objects modified while the application was running. It then sweeps
through and garbage collects. Though it sounds more complicated, this
has the effect of greatly reducing the amount of time that execution
needs to be halted to clean out dead objects.

Just about every aspect of the way memory management works in Java can
be tuned. In your profiling, you may want to experiment with some of the
following settings to see if any of them can increase your performance.

\textbf{NewSize, MaxNewSize:} The initial size and the maximum size of
the New or Young Generation.

\textbf{+UseParNewGC:} Causes garbage collection to happen in parallel,
using multiple CPUs. This decreases garbage collection overhead and
increases application throughput.

\textbf{+UseConcMarkSweepGC:} Use the Concurrent Mark-Sweep Garbage
Collector. This uses shorter garbage collection pauses, and is good for
applications that have a relatively large set of long-lived data, and
that run on machines with two or more processors, such as web servers.

\textbf{+CMSParallelRemarkEnabled:} For the CMS GC, enables the garbage
collector to use multiple threads during the CMS remark phase. This
decreases the pauses during this phase.

\textbf{SurvivorRatio:} Controls the size of the two survivor spaces.
It's a ratio between the survivor space size and Eden. The default is
25. There's not much bang for the buck here, but it may need to be
adjusted.

\textbf{ParallelGCThreads:} The number of threads to use for parallel
garbage collection. Should be equal to the number of CPU cores in your
server.

A sample configuration using the above parameters might look something
like this:

\begin{verbatim}
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -XX:NewSize=700m -XX:MaxNewSize=700m -Xms2048m
-Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
-XX:+CMSParallelRemarkEnabled -XX:SurvivorRatio=20
-XX:ParallelGCThreads=8"
\end{verbatim}

Again, you should always follow the procedure of adjusting the settings,
then testing under load, then adjusting again. Every system is different
and these are general guidelines to follow. Next, we'll see some
modifications we can make to Liferay's properties to help increase
performance.

\subsection{Properties File Changes}\label{properties-file-changes}

There are also some changes you can make to your
\texttt{portal-ext.properties} file once you are in a production
environment.

Set this property to true to load the theme's merged CSS files for
faster loading for production. By default it is set to false for easier
debugging for development. You can also disable fast loading by setting
the URL parameter \texttt{css\_fast\_load} to \texttt{0}.

\begin{verbatim}
theme.css.fast.load=true
\end{verbatim}

Set this property to true to load the combined JavaScript files from the
property \texttt{java\-script\-.files} into one compacted file for faster
loading for production.

\begin{verbatim}
javascript.fast.load=true
\end{verbatim}

These are various things the Liferay engineering team has done to
increase performance generally. If your developers make use of Liferay's
tools and platform, their Java\-Script and themes can also take advantage
of these properties.

Let's look at one final, general way of increasing Liferay's
performance: disabling unused servlet filters.

\subsection{Disabling Unused Servlet
Filters}\label{disabling-unused-servlet-filters}

Liferay comes by default with a number of servlet filters enabled and
running. It is likely that for your installation, you don't need them
all. Since servlet filters intercept the HTTP request and do some
processing on it before Liferay even has a chance to start building the
page, you can increase performance by disabling the ones you're not
using.

You can disable servlet filters you're not using by using your
\texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file. Copy the \emph{Servlet Filters}
section from the original \texttt{por\-tal.pro\-per\-ties} file into your
customized file, and then go through the list and see if there are any
you can disable, by setting them to \texttt{false}.

For example, if you are not using CAS for single sign-on, disable the
CAS Filter. If you are not using NTLM for single sign-ons, disable the
NTLM Filter. The fewer servlet filters you are running, the less
processing power is needed for each request.

As you can see, there are many things you can do to increase Liferay's
performance generally. But don't forget to load test your own
applications! It may be that a performance issue comes from a
custom-built application that's doing something it shouldn't do. Always
load test your system before putting it into production: that's the best
way of finding out potential performance problems, and that way, you'll
find them during performance testing, and not when your system is in
production.

Next, you'll learn how to configure a Content Delivery Network, which
can also help with your portal's performance.

\section{Content Delivery Network}\label{content-delivery-network}

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is an interconnected system of servers
deployed in multiple data centers that use geographical proximity as a
criteria to deliver content across the Internet. For more information on
CDNs and their general use cases and technical details, visit the
Wikipedia article on CDN.\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network}}

First, you'll discover the perks of using a CDN in Liferay and learn
about general guidelines for using a CDN in your Liferay Portal
instance. Then, you'll learn the steps to configure a CDN for your
portal. It's time to expand your Liferay content around the world!

\subsection{Using CDN for Performance
Enhancements}\label{using-cdn-for-performance-enhancements}

A CDN serves static content to users in a Liferay Portal instance. These
static resources (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) from the portal are
stored on multiple servers around the world, and when requested, are
retrieved by the server nearest to the user.

The CDN functions as a caching proxy, meaning that once static content
is copied to a local server, it is stored in a cache for quick and easy
retrieval. This drastically improves latency time, because browsers can
download static resources from a local server down the street instead of
halfway around the world. A user's request to the CDN for content is
directed to a server machine using an algorithm. That algorithm attempts
to use a server closest to the user. The figure below shows a visual
representation of using geographical proximity to improve latency.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/cdn-map.png}
\caption{\\Figure 22.8: The red lines on the map represent the required
distances traveled by requests from a server to the user. Using CDN
allows a user to request static resources from a much closer local
server, improving download times.}
\end{figure}

Because of the reduced wait time for requests and reduced load on your
application server, a CDN is a great option to improve your portal's
performance. Using a CDN with Liferay, however, has some restrictions.

Liferay only works with CDNs that can dynamically retrieve requested
resources from Liferay. For this reason, you should check with your CDN
provider to make sure you don't have to upload anything to them manually
in order for it to work. The CDN must fetch the content itself.

There are several properties in Liferay that enable you to configure
your CDN and tweak it to your portal's needs. You'll cover how to do
this next.

\subsection{Configuring Liferay to Use a
CDN}\label{configuring-liferay-to-use-a-cdn}

Now that you have a general understanding of what a CDN accomplishes and
how it's used in Liferay, it's time to set one up for yourself. You can
set your CDN and its properties using two different methods: editing
your portal's properties file or using the Control Panel.

To configure your CDN by properties file, you'll need to create a
\texttt{por\-tal-ext.pro\-per\-ties} file in your Liferay Home directory and
set the appropriate CDN properties. You can view the CDN properties and
their descriptions by visiting the
\href{http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html\#Content\%20Delivery\%20Network}{Content
Delivery Network} section of the \texttt{portal.properties} HTML
document.

Once you configure your CDN host, static assets automatically get
uploaded to the CDN, and Liferay generates URLs to them that replace the
old host with your new CDN host.

To configure your CDN in the Control Panel, navigate to the Control
Panel $\rightarrow$\emph{Portal Settings}. In the main configuration, you'll notice
three fields related to CDNs:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{CDN Host HTTP}
\item
  \emph{CDN Host HTTPS}
\item
  \emph{CDN Dynamic Resources Enabled}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\scalegraphics{../../images/cdn-control-panel.png}
\caption{\\Figure 22.9: The Control Panel lets you configure your portal's
CDN.}
\end{figure}

These properties are exactly the same as the ones you can specify in
your \texttt{por\-tal-ext\-.pro\-per\-ties}. Make sure to visit the CDN section
of the Properties Document referenced previously if you don't know how
to fill in the CDN fields. Once you're finished, click \emph{Save} and
your old host is replaced with your new CDN host for static content.

As you can see, configuring a CDN is extremely easy, and can drastically
reduce latency time and improve your portal's performance.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-21}

We've seen how good a fit Liferay Portal is for the enterprise. It can
be scaled linearly to grow to whatever size you need to serve your
users. Liferay Cloud Services lets you manage and monitor your Liferay
instances from a single interface. Clustering is also a snap, and
Liferay harmonizes very well with whatever environment you may have.

Liferay Portal is also built for performance. You can take advantage of
read-writer database configurations, as well as database sharding. You
can tune it to support over 3300 concurrent users on a single server
with mean login times under half a second and maximum throughput of more
than 79 logins per second. We've seen some tips for tuning Liferay
Portal, and we have to keep in mind the adage about tuning: load test
and profile, tune, repeat.

Configuring a Content Delivery Network is also advantageous when you
want to increase your portal's performance. By accessing static
resources from a local server, latency time and your application
server's load are drastically reduced.

In all, Liferay Portal gives you all the options you need to build a
high-performance, robust environment that supports your enterprise.
